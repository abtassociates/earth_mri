A national digital geologic map database is essential in interpreting other datasets that support numerous types of national-scale studies and assessments, such as those that provide geochemistry, remote sensing, or geophysical data. The SGMC is a compilation of the individual U.S. Geological Survey releases of the Preliminary Integrated Geologic Map Databases for the United States. The SGMC geodatabase also contains updated data for six States and seven entirely new State geologic maps that have been added since the preliminary databases were published. Numerous errors have been corrected and enhancements added to the preliminary datasets using thorough quality assurance/quality control procedures. The SGMC is not a truly integrated geologic map database because geologic units have not been reconciled across State boundaries. However, the geologic data contained in each State geologic map have been standardized to allow spatial analyses of lithology, age, and stratigraphy at a national scale.",NA,NA,"conterminous United States","quality assurance; quality control",NA

A mineral systems approach based on current understanding of how ore deposits that contain critical minerals form and relate to broader geologic frameworks and the tectonic history of the Earth was used to satisfy this Earth MRI need. This report describes the rationale for, and structure of, a table developed for Earth MRI that relates critical minerals and principal commodities to the deposit types and mineral systems in which they are concentrated. The hierarchical relationship between systems, deposits, commodities, and critical minerals makes it possible to define and prioritize each system-based focus area once for all of the critical minerals that it may contain. This approach is advantageous because mineral systems are much larger than individual ore deposits and they generally have geologic features that can be 'imaged' by the topographic, geologic, geochemical, and geophysical mapping techniques deployed by Earth MRI.",NA,NA,"Critical minerals in the United States","mineral systems approach; topographic mapping; geologic mapping; geochemical mapping; geophysical mapping",NA

Key questions regarding provenance, pathways of minerals to deposit sites, and relations to geologic features remain unexplained. As part of a national effort to collect data over regions prospective for critical minerals, the first public high-resolution aeroradiometric survey over the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain was conducted over Quaternary sediments in South Carolina. The new data provide an unprecedented view of potential deposits by imaging Th-bearing minerals in the heavy mineral assemblage. Sand ridges show the highest radiometric Th values with localized, linear anomalies, especially along the shoreface and in areas reworked by multiple processes and/or during multiple episodes. Estuarine areas with finer-grained sediments show lower, distributed Th anomalies. Th values averaged over geologic unit areas are similar for both environments, suggesting that heavy minerals are present but have not been locally concentrated in the lower-energy estuarine environments. Radiometric K highlights immature minerals such as mica and potassium feldspar. K is elevated within shallow sediments younger than ca. 130 ka, an attribute that persists in regional data from northern South Carolina to northern Florida. Both K and Th are elevated over the floodplains of the Santee River and other rivers with headwaters in the igneous and metamorphic Piedmont Terrane. The persistence of K anomalies for distances of more than 100 km from the Santee River floodplain suggests that heavy minerals are delivered from the Piedmont to offshore areas by major rivers, transported along the coast by the longshore current, and redeposited onshore by marine processes.",NA,NA,"U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain","high-resolution aeroradiometric survey",NA

A renewed interest in critical minerals in the US and the world has become the focus of research in understanding ore formation, mineral-resource potential and ore production of these important mineral deposits. Alkaline-igneous rocks, including carbonatites, are known for their associated critical minerals deposits. The North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt is one such area known for gold, molybdenum, rare earth elements (REEs) and critical minerals deposits associated with Eocene–Miocene (45.6–22.8 Ma) alkaline-igneous rocks and carbonatites. The belt extends southward from Alaska and British Columbia into New Mexico and eastern Mexico. Gold, molybdenum and critical minerals such as REEs, tellurium, fluorine, zirconium and niobium have been found and locally exploited along this belt. In New Mexico (the focus of this paper), the belt extends southward from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the Cornudas Mountains, in the northern Trans-Pecos alkaline belt. The mineral deposits in the North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt are controlled by composition and source of alkaline magmas, regional and local structures and development of multiple hydrothermal systems during the transition from Laramide compression (75–40 Ma) to Rio Grande rift extension (28–5 Ma). Three predominant types of mineral deposits are found in the North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt: (1) alkalic-type epithermal gold; (2) Climax-type porphyry molybdenum; and (3) magmatic REE deposits (including veins and breccia deposits in adjacent host rocks). A fourth deposit type, small alkalic porphyry copper–gold deposits, is found in a few districts. Many of the mineral deposits in this belt formed at or after peak activity of a local magmatic cycle. Magmas and sulfur were derived from melting of the lower crust to upper mantle (as indicated by isotopic data from several deposits) resulting in the diversity of mineral deposits in the southern North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt. Most of the magmatic REE deposits occurred during the transitional period (40–28 Ma), whereas the Climax-type porphyry molybdenum deposits occurred mostly at the beginning of rifting (25–24 Ma). The alkali-epithermal gold and small alkalic porphyry deposits occurred at the end of the Laramide orogeny and during the transitional period before rifting. Most alkalic-type epithermal gold deposits in New Mexico are found in hydrothermal breccia pipes and skarns with anomalous, but uneconomic concentrations of REEs and tellurium. Alkalic-type epithermal and alkalic porphyry copper–gold deposits in New Mexico are found in the Ortiz Mountains in Santa Fe County (Carache Canyon, Lucas Canyon). Many districts in the belt have future critical minerals potential. Tellurium is found at Cripple Creek, Colorado and Organ Mountains, New Mexico. Tungsten was locally produced in the past from two of these gold deposits (Elizabethtown and White Oaks) and is found in the Ortiz Mountains deposits. The Climax-type molybdenum deposits, including the Questa deposit, contain anomalous, but uneconomic, concentrations of beryllium and fluorite. The magmatic REE deposits in Laughlin Peak, Gallinas, Capitan and Cornudas mountains, New Mexico, generally contain anomalous, but uneconomic, concentrations of zircon, niobium, fluorite and gold, and generally low tellurium, tungsten and beryllium concentrations. The magmatic REE deposits in the Gallinas Mountains are among the highest ranked deposits for economic potential for REEs in New Mexico; some samples contain as much as 8% total REEs. Some samples in the Cornudas Mountains contain as much as 3110 ppm total REEs, mostly in eudialyte. A mineral concentrate of the REE-bearing minerals (eudialyte, zircon, monazite, bastnäsite, calcio-catapleiite, vitusite, roumaite, xenotime) could be obtained after mining by magnetic separation and REEs could be leached from that concentrate.",NA,"US Geological Survey (USGS) National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program; New Mexico Geological Society; New Mexico Tech Brightstar Scholarship; Society of Economic Geology","North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt",NA,NA

The new aeromagnetic data provide an unprecedented view of buried basement structures. NE- and NW-trending lineaments of various lengths throughout the survey area are interpreted as Paleozoic orogenic structures and Mesozoic dikes, respectively. Within the rift basin, 15- to 20-km long ESE-trending lineaments are associated with faults in pre-Cretaceous strata of the reflection data and are interpreted as Mesozoic rift structures. Various intersections and terminations of interpreted faults suggest rift-related reactivation of Paleozoic faults and corresponding inheritance for Mesozoic structures. The reflection data show that several Paleozoic and Mesozoic faults are associated with deformation in Cretaceous and younger sediments, suggesting reactivation in the more recent passive margin setting. Two of these faults, one NE-striking and one ESE-striking, are coincident with surficial landforms, suggesting Quaternary slip; the ESE-striking fault is also well-aligned with a plan-view offset in modern seismicity.

The Wet Mountains are known for thorium and REE mineralization associated with failed rift-related, Ediacaran-Ordovician alkaline intrusions and veins. Structural field data indicate that alkaline dikes and mineralized veins are controlled by a system of northwest-striking, high-angle faults and tension fractures formed in a 040°-directed extensional regime. Magnetic and surface expressions of Democrat Creek and McClure Mountain complexes show tectonic elongation toward ∼045°, consistent with NE-directed extension. Magnetic data also suggest the existence of a fourth, previously unrecognized mafic-ultramafic complex of inferred Cambrian age with a similar elongated orientation. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) 208 Pb/ 232 Th analysis of low-uranium zircon from carbonatite dikes and in situ 206 Pb/ 238 U LA-ICP-MS analysis of monazite in mineralized dikes yielded 465 ± 18 Ma and 489 ± 33 Ma ages, respectively. These ages are consistent with the expected age based on slightly older, cross-cut syenite dikes and the hypothesized Ordovician end to failed rift-related magmatism.

Due to technological advances, demand has increased for critical minerals used in cell phones, magnets in wind turbines, batteries for electric vehicles, smart weapons, and other devices and systems. The overall objective of the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI) program, directed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is to gather information that will help better understand the distribution of critical minerals in the United States. This report details the Phase I Earth MRI activities conducted by the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS), including a review of more than 1,400 mineral and rock specimens that resulted in the inventory of 486 specimens relevant to future Earth MRI work. Furthermore, 3,590 digital files were reviewed and indexed with keywords and other attributes to create an upgraded online map service, the Kentucky Mineral Resources Information Map Service, with advanced search functions. Thirty-nine probable igneous dikes that may be an economically viable source of REEs were identified using a filtered aeromagnetic dataset provided by the USGS, and these features were incorporated into a 1:50,000-scale geological map that covers the WKFD. The total REE content (including yttrium and scandium) in 66 analyzed dike samples range from 152 ppm to 620 ppm with an average of 341 ppm. The various types of igneous dikes that have been identified—alnöite, aillikite, and rocks in which carbonate alteration predominates—have overlapping but somewhat distinct concentrations of REEs with alnöite samples having the highest, the carbonate alteration predominant samples the lowest, and the aillikite samples intermediate average total REE values. The relatively high REE content in one massive calcite vein (280 ppm) suggests remobilization of REEs and warrants further study of fluid–rock interactions to better understand the mineral system of the WKFD.",NA,"National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program of the U.S. Geological Survey","Western Kentucky Fluorspar District","review of mineral and rock specimens; digital file indexing; geological mapping; filtered aeromagnetic dataset analysis",NA

Coordinated with these efforts are programs supporting geologic mapping and airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) surveys that yield detailed surface topographic models of the terrain over the same regions spanned by the geophysical surveys. The collaboration leverages resources from the USGS and DOE to acquire large regional datasets that will provide fundamental data necessary to map surface and subsurface geology and structure to benefit mineral and resource program objectives of both agencies. Such regionally uniform datasets are important for geothermal research to assist in identifying geologically favorable settings and as invaluable inputs in predictive models targeting undiscovered resources that use knowledge-driven (e.g., play fairway analysis) or data-driven approaches (e.g., machine-learning methods) to reduce risk associated with resource exploration. These data will also serve a wide range of other related activities from hazard (earthquake, volcano, landslide, environmental) and resource (water, mineral, energy) studies, to mapping and land management. Surveys were conducted in two areas that were selected because they host substantial geothermal and mineral potential in California and Nevada. The data will aid several ongoing USGS and DOE projects aimed at characterizing geothermal and mineral systems, understanding the factors controlling their occurrence, and improving future national resource assessments. The first of these surveys (referred to as GeoDAWN) was collected over northern and western Nevada and eastern California and spans areas of major resource potential associated with the Walker Lane and western Great Basin. This includes Clayton Valley, which hosts substantial lithium brine and clay resources, and the Humboldt Mafic Complex, which constitutes a potentially important resource of critical minerals (including cobalt, rare earth elements, platinum group elements, iron, chromium, nickel, and copper). The second survey area (referred to as GeoFlight) is focused over the Salton Trough in southern California that contains some of the largest and hottest known hydrothermal systems in the world, as well as a substantial lithium brine resource that could potentially meet the nation’s lithium demand for electric vehicles. Data from both surveys will be made publicly available through USGS publications and online data repositories.

The prosperity of our Nation depends on generating a resilient supply of domestic critical minerals; mine waste may be an untapped source of these commodities. Mine waste from centuries of legacy mining persist on the landscape and may contain critical minerals and other valuable commodities previously deemed uneconomic to recover. At modern mines, the financial viability of recovering byproduct critical minerals, which are not the primary target, may be marginal and can ultimately destine them to mine waste. Further, mine waste can be a liability for the mining company or, at legacy mines, the taxpayer because of its effect on the landscape. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has several initiatives to evaluate critical mineral resources in various types of waste. This factsheet highlights studies of mine waste carried out by USGS scientists at the Geology, Energy & Minerals Science Center in collaboration with other science centers funded through the USGS Mineral Resources Program. Recovery of critical minerals from mine waste can aid in remediation efforts and increase domestic supply of vital mineral resources.","critical minerals; mine waste; U.S. Geological Survey; mineral resources",NA,NA,"mineralogical characterization; geochemical characterization; mapping",NA

Aluminum-rich clays associated with coal horizons represent potentially significant low-grade, large-volume, critical mineral resources. Past studies show that alumina is routinely 20-40% in these clay layers, and preliminary geochemical data indicate that some clay beds host elevated (>300 ppm) rare earth element (REE) concentrations. However, understanding of the distribution of metals in varying lithologies and stratigraphic positions is limited by data density and a lack of modern geochemical data. As part of a first of a kind, multi-year study, over one thousand stratigraphic and spatially representative underclay samples were collected from eight states in the Appalachian and Illinois basins and were geochemically analyzed by the USGS. Initial results of the regional geochemical reconnaissance study showed ranges of total REEs from 1292 ppm to 53 ppm in the Appalachian Basin and 1205 ppm to 8 ppm in the Illinois Basin. Relative enrichment of individual elements was analyzed by tau plots; phosphates and/or Al-rich phases seem to be the primary controls on REE enrichment, while XRD confirmed that the clays’ mineralogical content did not hold any REE associated minerals.",NA,NA,"Central and Eastern United States","Geochemical analysis; ICP-OES-MS; WDXRF; Handheld XRF; XRD",NA

This dataset provides a regionally consistent magnetic grid while retaining as much detail as possible of the originating data by leveling all the region's magnetic grids to one another. This 100-m cell-size magnetic grid of the YTU will assist in evaluating the region's geologic structure, geologic processes, tectonic evolution, and mineral resource potential. The grid was compiled from previous studies published by the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS).",NA,NA,"Yukon-Tanana Upland, Alaska",NA,NA
