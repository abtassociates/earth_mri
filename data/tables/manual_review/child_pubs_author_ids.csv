One of the major components of decarbonization are “green energy” technologies, e.g. wind turbines and electric vehicles. However, they themselves create new sustainability challenges, e.g. use of green energy contributes to the reduction of consumption of fossil fuels, on one hand, but at the same time it increases demand for permanent magnets containing considerable amounts of rare earth elements (REEs). This article provides the first global analysis of environmental impact of using rare earth elements in green energy technologies. The analysis was performed applying system dynamics modelling methodology integrated with life cycle assessment and geometallurgical approach. We provide evidence that an increase by 1% of green energy production causes a depletion of REEs reserves by 0.18% and increases GHG emissions in the exploitation phase by 0.90%. Our results demonstrate that between 2010 and 2020, the use of permanent magnets has resulted cumulatively in 32 billion tonnes CO2-equivalent of GHG emissions globally. It shows that new approaches to decarbonization are still needed, in order to ensure sustainability of the process. The finding highlights a need to design and implement various measures intended to increase REEs reuse, recycling (currently below 1%), limit their dematerialization, increase substitution and develop new elimination technologies. Such measures would support the development of appropriate strategies for decarbonization and environmentally sustainable development of green energy technologies.",NA,NA,NA,system dynamics modelling methodology; life cycle assessment; geometallurgical approach,"D Talan, Q Huang - Minerals Engineering, 2022 - Elsevier",2022,"Rare earth elements (REEs) are vital for the technology, military, and defense industries.

Early studies on rare earth trade have focused on supply and demand (Yan and Li, 2020; Deng et al., 2021; Ilankoon, et al., 2022), policy adjustment (Morrison and Tang, 2012; Tukker, 2014; Volker, 2021), environmental pollution (Viana et al., 2022; Golroudbaryet al., 2022; Talan and Huang, 2022), recycling and sustainable development (Schulze and Buchert, 2016; Bailey et al., 2016; Henriques and Böhm, 2022). Through the application of complex network analysis, some scholars realized that bilateral trade between two countries does not exist in isolation. The main conclusions are as follows. The global rare earth trade follows the Pareto principle, and the trade network shows a scale-free distribution. China has emerged as the world’s largest importer and exporter of rare earth since 2017. In the dependency network, China has become the most dependent country since 2006. The result of community division shows that China has separated from the American community and formed new communities with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.

The incorporation of graphene into concrete can address issues such as brittleness, low tensile strength, and permeability. Graphene offers great potential as a concrete additive because of its remarkable features such as efficient heat and electrical conductivity, as well as remarkable strength. Several forms of graphene such as graphene oxide (GO), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and functionalized graphene (FG), have been tested, and all have shown improvements in compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). The two-dimensional nature of graphene allows it to have a high specific surface area, making it an attractive construction and building material. The use of graphene in concrete can help lower global CO2 emissions, making the construction industry more sustainable. The incorporation of a very small quantity of graphene can increase the strength of conventional concrete, reducing the environmental footprint. The article discusses the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) study, which indicates that making 1 kg of commercial GNPs resulted in lower CO2 emissions than OPC.

In this study, we focus on the role of two poorly understood and little studied components of LIP plumbing systems: giant circumferential dyke swarms and mid-crustal igneous complexes. Giant circumferential dyke swarms, which have only recently been recognized, are often associated with giant radiating dyke swarms, whose foci are located at or near the centres of the circumferential swarms. The giant radiating swarms are usually interpreted to be generated during domal uplift above a mantle plume. We compare giant circumferential dyke swarms, giant radiating dyke swarms and coupled circumferential-radiating dyke systems with possible analogues on Venus, called coronae, novae and corona-nova systems, respectively. Coronae are large tectonomagmatic features that typically include a quasi-circular/elliptical annulus of graben that are thought to be underlain by dykes. Novae are large radiating graben systems that are also thought to be underlain by dykes. Coronae, novae and coupled corona-nova systems are usually interpreted to be generated above mantle plumes or diapirs.

In these areas, the drinking water supply largely relies on groundwater characterised by elevated fluoride concentration (> 1.5 mg/L), resulting from interactions with the surrounding alkaline volcanic rocks. This geochemical anomaly is often associated with the presence of other naturally occurring potentially toxic elements (PTEs), such as As, Mo, U, V, which are known to cause adverse effects on human health. This study reports on the occurrence of such PTEs in the groundwater on the populated flanks of Mt. Meru, an active volcano situated in the EARV. Our results show that the majority of analysed PTEs (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Sr, Pb, and Zn) are within the acceptable limits for drinking purpose in samples collected from wells, springs and tap systems, suggesting that there is no immediate health risk associated with these PTEs. However, some of the samples were found to exceed the WHO tolerance limit for U (> 30 μg/L) and Mo (> 70 μg/L). The sample analysis also revealed that in some of the collected samples, the concentrations of total dissolved solids, Na + and K + exceed the permissible limits. The concerning levels of major parameters and PTEs were found to be associated with areas covered with debris avalanche deposits on the northeast flank, and volcanic ash and alluvial deposits on the southwest flanks of the volcano.

The current approach is to conduct on-site investigations or simplified statistical analyses, which are generally time-consuming and bear high uncertainties, except for the most obvious cases.

The timing and rates of cooling determines the likely post‐orogenic exhumation history of the northern Appalachian Foreland Basin (NAB) in New York and Pennsylvania. AFT ages generally young from west to east, decreasing from ~185 to 120 Ma. AHe single‐grain ages range from ~188 to 116 Ma. Models show that this part of the Appalachian foreland basin experienced a non‐uniform, multi‐stage cooling history.

Our results from the Mesozoic are broadly consistent with earlier studies, but with the integration of multiple thermochronometers and multi‐kinetic annealing algorithms in newer inverse thermal modeling programs, we constrain a Late Cenozoic increase in cooling which had been previously enigmatic in eastern U.S. low‐temperature thermochronology datasets. Multi‐stage cooling and exhumation of the NAB is driven by post‐orogenic basin inversion and catchment drainage reorganization, in response to changes in base level due to rifting, plus isostatic and dynamic topographic processes modified by flexure over the long (~200 Myr) post‐orogenic period.

We use the South Platte River watershed of Colorado, USA as a case study to illustrate spatial patterns of, and controls on, floodplain carbon stocks at the watershed scale. This case study illustrates the disproportionate importance of floodplains for soil carbon stocks relative to adjacent uplands and provides an example of how spatially explicit data can be used to prioritize floodplain restoration with regard to carbon sequestration. We use the hydrogeomorphic floodplain tool GFPLAIN to delineate the extent of 100-year floodplains in the South Platte River watershed. We distinguish elevation bands for the steppe, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones. We also differentiate bead (floodplain width/channel width ≥ 5) and string (floodplain width/channel width < 5) reaches within the montane and subalpine zones. Drawing on prior, field-based measurements of organic carbon stock in downed, dead wood and soil in these floodplain types, we estimate total floodplain organic carbon stock based on median values of stock in different floodplain types and the spatial extent of these floodplain types. This estimate includes organic carbon stocks in lake and reservoir sediments in the watershed. Soil constitutes the greatest reservoir of floodplain carbon. The total estimated area of floodplain is 2916 km 2 , which is 4.3 % of the total watershed area of the South Platte River. Our preferred estimate is 42.7 Tg C stock (likely range of 39.1–42.7 Tg). This equates to 11.1 % of a previously estimated overall carbon stock (above and belowground biomass and soil organic carbon) in the entire watershed of 384 Tg C. Floodplains are thus disproportionately important, relative to their surface area, in storing organic carbon in this semiarid watershed.

In this work, a solvent-based direct recycling route for anode and cathode coating materials is presented that allows direct reuse of the recovered coating materials. A high yield of recovery is achieved by mechanical stress in a suitable solvent (96% for anodes, 85% for cathodes). The resulting suspension is used for electrode production to study the influence of direct recycled material on the resulting electrode and cell performance. It can be seen that the electrodes and cells with up to 10% recyclate content have similar high performance in terms of electrical conductivities, initial discharge capacity (approx. 165 mAh g −1 for graphite/NMC622 coin cells) and C-rate stability.

High mountain lakes integrate changes in the atmosphere and catchment areas (e.g., acid rain, airborne pollutants, climate change). The present research analyses long-term datasets of meteorological and limnological variables representing two tropical high mountain lakes, El Sol and La Luna, in Central Mexico to identify the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., sentinels of global/climate change). The 54-year meteorological analysis showed marked interannual variability with no statistically significant air temperature or rainfall trends. However, from 2000 to 2018, the air temperature increased by 0.5 °C. Accordingly, the lake water temperature increased (Lake El Sol: 0.8 °C, Lake La Luna: 0.6 °C). Although the rainfall displayed no change, the water level decreased in both lakes (1.5 m), most likely associated with increased evapotranspiration. Unexpectedly, the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration in the lakes decreased. The initial acid pH rose to close neutrality in Lake La Luna and to alkaline values in Lake El Sol. The latter may be a consequence of the lowered SOx and NOx emissions from governmental regulations promulgated to control atmospheric pollution beginning in 2000 and probably resulting in less acidic deposition. An additional explanation for the lakes' deacidification is the increased deposition of alkaline ions derived from activities at the volcano slopes. Since the atmospheric supply is the primary nitrogen source to high mountain lakes, the DIN concentration decline could reflect the reduction in atmospheric HNO 3. Thus, Lakes El Sol and La Luna evidenced global change. Both lakes are inside the same crater and are subjected to similar influences; thus, they showed similar responses to global change (increasing lake water temperatures, declining water levels, higher pH value, and lower DIN concentrations).

The volume of sediment currently stored in two major catchments was estimated using high-resolution LiDAR and geometric reconstructions of depth to bedrock.

The volume of post-glacial sediment stored in the canyons and bay totals 173.82 ± 19.5336.0 (×10 −3 km 3 ), which translates to a catchment-wide sediment production rate of 0.17 ± 0.02 mm/yr. The rock-equivalent sediment volume in Moran Bay is 4.4 ± 0.9 (×10 −3 km 3 ), only ∼2.6% of the total post-glacial volume.

The fluvial system has been disequilibrated by glacial erosion such that interglacial valley profiles lack the steepness needed to transport sediment, delaying sediment evacuation until the next glacial advance, or until uplift sufficiently steepens the fluvial system so that it regains efficiency.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to decrease the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere and develop reliable methods for its storage. Subsurface carbon mineralization is an effective solution to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 emissions. This study is focused on investigating anhydrite–CO 2 –brine interactions as a means of carbon storage in anhydrite-rich reservoirs. To achieve this, we conducted experiments involving anhydrite-rich rock exposed to supercritical CO 2 -brine environments. Notably, we conducted a novel mineral transformation of an outcrop anhydrite-rich rock within a static reactor, replicating subsurface conditions of high temperature (333 K) and pressure (104 bar). These experiments were conducted over fifteen days, both in the absence and presence of BaCl 2. A comprehensive suite of mineralogical, elemental, and geochemical analyses was employed, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ion chromatographic (IC) analysis, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) assessments. These analyses allowed capturing the changes occurring in the rock's structure and composition due to the CO 2 -brine interactions. The outcomes revealed that anhydrite, when exposed to supercritical CO 2 -saturated brine, undergoes a significant mineral transformation. This mineral modification leads to the formation of stable minerals, including calcite, siderite, feldspar, and barite. Consequently, there was an observed increase in total carbon (TC) content of up to 177 % for the CO 2 -brine treatment and 266 % for the CO 2 -brine + BaCl 2 treatment.

Implementation of production as such would require restoration of elements of the rare earth value chain that have recently been absent in the U.S., notably for chemical extraction of rare earth compounds from the mineral form (i.e. hydrometallurgical extraction). A variety of existing technologies are available for use in both mineral processing and extractive metallurgy applied to RE production in the U.S. As will be discussed, once a mineral concentrate is produced, the contained rare earth value can be large compared with transportation costs, and the sections of the value chain dealing with chemical extraction (the largest cost) and separation into individual rare earth compounds can be remotely located. Also, as will be discussed, this has been the rule rather than exception in the history of the rare earth industry in the U.S. A strategy, possibly to include repurposing of existing metallurgical processing facilities, will be presented for near-term production, using a decentralized set of facilities. Also presented will be research results from the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) and the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), within the U.S. Department of Energy, relevant to economic feasibility of rare earth production, notably from the standpoint of establishing which materials are capable of providing economic production. Simple methodologies are presented for both establishment of cutoff grades and economic evaluation of a process. The goal of this report is to present an overview of methods and pathways that will result in 'the achievement of near-term rare earth production, using currently available technologies to produce a mixed, chemical extracted rare earth concentrate, and existing and new facilities to produce separated rare earths that can 'plug in' to the metals and magnet production facilities.'

However, there is an obvious need for the development of tools for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) before EW can be brought to scale. Shifts in the concentration of mobile elements measured in the solid phase of soils after application of EW feedstocks can potentially be used to track weathering and provide an estimate of the initial carbon dioxide removal of the system. To measure feedstock dissolution accurately it is necessary to control for the amount of feedstock originally present in the sample being analyzed. This can be achieved by measuring the concentration of immobile detrital elements in soil samples after feedstock addition. However, the resolvability of a signal using a soil mass balance approach depends on analytical uncertainty, the ability to accurately sample soils, the amount of feedstock relative to the amount of initial soil in a sample, and on the fraction of feedstock that has dissolved. Here, we assess the viability of soil-based mass-balance approaches across different settings. Specifically, we define a metric for tracer-specific resolvability of feedstock mass addition (φ) and calculate the feedstock application rates (a) and dissolution fractions (b) required to resolve EW. Applying calculations of a, b, and φ to a gridded soil database from the contiguous USA in combination with known compositions of basalt and peridotite feedstocks demonstrates the importance of adequately capturing field heterogeneity in soil elemental concentrations. While EW signals should be resolvable after ~1–3 years of basalt feedstock addition at common application rates for most agricultural settings with adequate sampling protocols, resolving EW in the field is likely to be challenging if uncertainties in tracer concentrations derived from field-scale heterogeneity and analytical error exceed 10%. Building from this framework, we also present a simple tool for practitioners to use to assess the viability of carrying out soil-based EW MRV in a deployment-specific context.",NA,NA,contiguous USA,solid-phase mass balance approaches; theoretical mixing model; aggregated analytical and sampling uncertainty,"TJ Suhrhoff, T Reershemius, J Wang, JS Jordan… - Frontiers in …, 2024 - frontiersin.org",2024,"Enhanced weathering (EW) of silicate rocks spread onto managed lands as agricultural amendments is a promising carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approach.

The relationship between Superior and Karelia-Kola is of interest because the position of the Karelia-Kola craton within the context of the Superia reconstruction is not fully resolved.

While hydrometallurgical methods using mineral acids are widely studied and recognized as effective, their environmental impact remains a major concern. This study explores deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as eco-friendly alternatives for recovering REEs from Fe-rich Australian tailings. Six different DES formulations were evaluated for their leaching efficiency, and the impact of alkali roasting on recovery efficiency was assessed. Additionally, the performance of the most effective DES was compared against the commonly used mineral acids—H₂SO₄, HCl, and HNO₃. The findings identified alkali roasting with KOH at 250 °C for 30 minutes, followed by leaching with a DES composed of choline chloride (ChCl) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) in a 2:1 molar ratio, as the most efficient approach. This method achieved up to 95 % leaching efficiency for total rare earth elements (TREEs) and Fe, along with 94 % material dissolution—significantly outperforming other DES formulations and the three mineral acids. The superior performance of the ChCl:PTSA was attributed to KOH roasting, which enhanced REEs liberation by breaking down complex mineral matrices into simpler oxides. Furthermore, KOH roasting required less energy than conventional roasting due to its lower temperature and shorter duration. The DES-based leaching process using ChCl:PTSA offered a promising green alternative for REEs recovery from Fe-rich tailings, providing high efficiency under mild operating conditions while reducing environmental impact.",NA,NA,Australia,deep eutectic solvents; alkali roasting; leaching efficiency evaluation,"SK Sarker, M Pownceby, S Yadav, W Bruckard… - Hydrometallurgy, 2024 - Elsevier",2024,The increasing demand for rare earth elements (REEs) has led to the exploration of mining tailings as a potential secondary source.

However, due to the absence of a systematic ICT-assisted mindset, no study has been oriented from the perspective of the dynamic inventory management and geographic data-driven features of land resources. To handle these challenges, this study introduces a vertically-coordinated heuristic optimization framework, in the form of an autonomous multi-agent system, for the LIRP of gas transmission infrastructures as major carrier systems to supply feedstock and energy demands. Various extendable behavior classes are programmed into the framework to support automated agent specializations regarding procedural tasks of planning, transient inventory coordination, routing, and spatial data management in the specific LIRP settings. Moreover, the study develops an ontology-driven knowledge system, formally conceptualizing the intended application-level knowledge according to a general domain semantic model. Leveraging the knowledge system, the agents determine the necessary steps and suitable ready-made tools to solve the problem collaboratively. Several industrial applications showcase the capabilities of the proposed framework. The results manifest that the devised ontology automates model construction and the entire solution process while supporting agent interoperation and scaling the platform applications to emergent domains. Additionally, transient demand fluctuations, dynamic inventory levels, and topological considerations heavily influence long-term planning. Compared to existing practices, the ontology-driven multi-agent framework expounds a more realistic view of the trade-off between strategic investments and dynamic operational welfare in the gas system. Such an automated and practical methodology, in turn, realizes AI-oriented cross-functional integrations in the enhanced product and energy sector.",NA,NA,NA,autonomous multi-agent system; ontology-driven knowledge system; heuristic optimization framework,"F Babaei, RB Boozarjomehry, ZK Ravandi… - … Energy, Grids and …, 2022 - Elsevier",2022,This study conveys a novel framework for co-expansion planning of an integrated gas network and methanol plant with natural gas feedstock while enforcing power network …,NA,16,URL:html,NA,"F Babaei, RB Boozarjomehry, ZK Ravandi…",67; 133; 977,"Babaei, F.; Boozarjomehry, R B; Ravandi, Z K",NA,301,1,1,3,3,Both fields were missing 1 new authors,"Pishvaie, S.M.R."

The global supply situation of these strategically valuable elements remains critical as the market is largely monopolistic. Thus, to alleviate the dependence on global imports, investments are being made in the research and development of innovative and cost-effective technologies for the indigenous processing and recovery of REEs from alternate sources that are cheap and abundant. Numerous research findings have identified potential benefits and proven the technological feasibility of extracting and selectively concentrating REEs from coal byproducts such as preparation plant rejects and acid mine drainage among other sources. Given the relatively low grades, the chemical cost associated with hydrometallurgical extraction of REEs from coal-derived feedstocks is excessively high for commercial extraction. Recent studies have been successful in increasing REE recovery and leaching kinetics by oxidation pretreatment of the coal-based feed. However, the reasons behind the positive oxidation effects have yet to be systematically studied to provide an understanding of the mineralogical changes and to utilize the knowledge for process development. Therefore, the current investigation aimed to comprehensively study the effect of oxidation parameters on the leaching characteristics of REEs contained in coal-based feedstocks.

Trees have deeper rooting profiles than agronomic crops, so evaluating the impacts of soils, geology, and physiographic province on forest productivity can help guide silvicultural management decisions in southern pine plantations. Here, we describe the Forest Productivity Cooperative’s “Site Productivity Optimization for Trees” (SPOT) system which includes: texture, depth to increase in clay content, drainage class, soil modifiers (i.e., surface attributes, mineralogy, and additional limitations such as root restrictions), geologic formations, and physiographic province. We quantified the total area for each SPOT code in the native range of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), the region’s most commercially important species, and used a remotely-sensed layer to quantify SPOT code areas in managed southern pine (approximately 14 million ha). The most common SPOT code in the native range is also the most planted, a B2WekoGgPD (fine loamy, shallow depth to increase in clay, well-drained, eroded, kaolinitic, granitic, Piedmont soil), spanning 1.1 million ha total, but only 12% in managed southern pine. However, the SPOT code with the greatest percentage of managed southern pine (61%; a D4PoioAmAF, spodic, deep to increase in clay, siliceous, middle Atlantic Coastal Plain, Flatwoods soil) was the 20th most common in the native range with 474,662 ha. We used machine learning and data from decades of “Regionwide” trials to assess the variable importance of SPOT constituents, climate, planting year, and N rate on site index (base age 25 years) and found that planting year was the most important variable, showing an increase of 17 cm site index per year since 1970, followed by maximum vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation. Geology was the top-ranking SPOT variable to explain site index followed by physiographic province. The Regionwide trials represent 72 unique SPOT codes (out of over 10,000 possible in the pine plantations) and approximately one million ha (or about 7% of all soils identified as supporting managed pine). To extrapolate site index values outside of the unique soil and geologic conditions empirically represented, we created a predictive model with an R2 of 0.79 and an RMSE of 1.38 m from SPOT codes alone. With this extrapolation, the Regionwide data predicts 10.5 million ha, or 74%, of all soils under loblolly pine management in its native range.

Using novel capsule techniques to minimize elemental loss, we performed piston-cylinder experiments to determine the mineral/melt partition coefficients (D min/melt) of In, Ga, and Ge between mafic minerals (amphibole, biotite, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and olivine), Fe–Ti oxides, and coexisting mafic to felsic melts. The experiments were conducted at 0.5–1.0 GPa and 770–1000 °C, with oxygen fugacity (f O 2) ranging from ∼FMQ − 2 to FMQ + 8. The results demonstrate that In, Ga, and Ge are generally weakly incompatible to moderately compatible (D min/melt = 0.5–11) in mafic minerals and Fe–Ti oxides. Exceptions include the incompatibility of In and Ga in olivine, and Ge in Fe–Ti oxides (D min/melt < 0.1–0.5). The D min/melt values of In, Ga, and Ge for all investigated minerals exhibit no dependence on f O 2, demonstrating the invariance of valence state for these elements (likely as In 3+, Ga 3+, and Ge 4+) under experimental and, by extension, crustal magmatic f O 2 conditions. The partitioning of In, Ga, and Ge is primarily controlled by melt composition, showing an increase of D min/melt with decreasing melt NBO/T and/or temperature. The influence of mineral composition is secondary. Specifically, the D In biotite/melt correlates negatively with octahedral Fe 2+, tetrahedral Al 3+, and octahedral Ti 4+, confirming previous findings. The D Ga pyroxene/melt shows a positive correlation with Al 2 O 3 content in both clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene. The obtained partition coefficients are used to model the behavior of these elements during partial melting of crustal rocks and subsequent magmatic fractional crystallization. We find that high degree of fractional crystallization significantly enriches In, Ga, and Ge in residual melts.

While we respect the excellent quality of the effort by Lundine and Trembanis on this topic, we offer a comment on their review of the runnable mental model presented in Davias and Harris (2022), and the companion paper Harris (2022). While there are several aspects of their review that we accept as debatable, central tenets of our hypothesis were overlooked. Primarily, Lundine and Trembanis (2025) entirely misrepresents our proposal as one which utilizes a mechanism of excavation of these shallow basins by secondary impacts into preexisting unconsolidated sediment. As clearly noted in the title, abstract and text of Davias and Harris (2022) we relate an interdisciplinary hypothesis that the basins were created within that sedimentary deposit during the catastrophic deposition of that sediment and manifested as cavitation artifacts at the surface. Our paper suggests a straightforward task to falsify: constrain the deposition date, method and source of the expansive conformal blanket we describe. Rather than being “thin ephemeral landforms” these basins should be viewed as robust structures, expressing to the surface and visible in our repository of LiDAR imagery despite having entire cities built across them. The lack of a prominent impact crater within the Great Lakes region of the USA is also addressed briefly here, as Lundine and Trembanis (2025) raised an objection.

The common view is that the pathological autoimmunity develops in genetically predisposed individuals upon exposure to an environmental trigger. This highlights the importance of recognizing and deconstructing the effects of environmental agents in rheumatic diseases. Several factors have been identified in the last decades, with detrimental or protective effects, impacting not only on disease onset, but also on its natural history. Cigarette smoking has been identified as one of the strongest environmental risk factors, being associated with disease development and severity for several rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and spondyloarthropathies. Moreover, other airborne pollutants, such as silica, solvents, asbestos and metals are recognized risk factors for rheumatic diseases. The effect of some other agents is however not straightforward, of which a remarkable example is alcohol consumption. Alcohol has been associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, exerting a variable effect on rheumatic diseases depending on quantity and frequency of consumption, as well as sex and ethnicity. Similarly, ultraviolet light exposure has been associated with a higher risk of SLE but lower risk of RA. The relationship between microbial exposure and autoimmunity is also complex: while some infectious agents increase the risk of rheumatic diseases, it is widely accepted that less exposure to microbial agents, particularly during immune system development, increases the risk of autoimmunity. Furthermore, in recent years the spotlight has switched to the human microbiome, as alterations in organ-specific microbiome composition are anticipated to be early participants in the onset of immune-mediated illnesses. The aim of this review is to highlight the most relevant environmental factors and their role in Rheumatology, with a specific focus on proposed pathophysiological effect and correlation with clinical outcomes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JC Pfau, B McLaurin, BJ Buck, FW Miller - Autoimmunity Reviews, 2024 - Elsevier",2024,"A growing body of evidence supports an association between systemic autoimmune disease and exposure to amphibole asbestos, a form of asbestos typically with straight, stiff, needle …",NA,20,URL:html,NA,"JC Pfau, B.

We sampled cavefishes and cave crayfishes at 61 sampling units using both visual and environmental DNA surveys.

Our results indicated that occurrence probability of cave crayfishes was negatively associated with human disturbance, whereas there was a weak positive relationship between cavefish occurrence and disturbance. Both cavefishes and cave crayfishes were more likely to occur in limestone rather than dolostone lithology.

We explore clinopyroxene zoning to track the evolution of peralkaline magmas and the mechanisms that trigger critical metal mineralisation, focusing on the Mesozoic Benolong Volcanic Suite in eastern Australia, which includes a zirconium + hafnium + niobium + tantalum mineralised subvolcanic sill. Major and trace element analysis of clinopyroxene across the volcanic field tracks continuous magma differentiation from diopside-hedenbergite to aegirine, associated with progressive enrichment of rare metals. Crucially, aegirine in the mineralised trachyte becomes sector-zoned and depleted in critical metals, which instead partition into latest-stage eudialyte. Association with vesiculated portions of the sill suggests that sector zoning is the product of undercooling which may be driven by degassing. Because volatiles increase the solubility of critical metals in silicate magmas, we suggest retention of volatiles and dynamic crystallisation conditions drive enrichment of critical metals in the Toongi deposit.

This study compared two outreach methods to improve home radon testing and examined the association between home radon levels and geologic data in Central Appalachian communities in Tazewell County, Virginia, and Mercer County, West Virginia. We recruited 327 residents via phone and 211 residents via in-person workshops in 2016 and 2017. In total, 538 radon test kits were distributed to residents for deployment in their homes and subsequent shipment to a certified laboratory for analysis. We received 225 valid test results, which were subsequently linked to geologic units derived from the United States Geological Survey based on geocoded addresses. Results indicate that participants recruited by phone were more likely to complete the home radon test than those recruited in-person from workshops. Of seven geologic formation categories in the study area, dolomite formations from the Cambrian–Ordovician period were associated with the highest median radon value, 4.25 pCi/L (0.38–124.45 pCi/L).

However, when it comes to assessing mining projects, engineers still use the same methods, such as NPV and IRR, to quantify the value of a project. In that sense, this study has three objectives: Understanding the limitations of the traditional model, analyzing the use of Real Options as an alternative to assess the value of a mining project under uncertain circumstances, and delving into the details of risk management in the mining industry. An open-pit case study is presented. Real Options are compared to the traditional methodologies to understand the situations where it is suitable to apply this tool. Two case studies are presented: one when the NPV is close to zero, and the other one, the NPV is far greater than zero. The results showed that using Real Options only adds value for projects with an NPV close to zero, while it has a detrimental effect when the NPV is very high.

Thereupon, the developing market of batteries reinforces the concern over the resilient and consistent supply of battery raw materials. By the reason of the interdependencies of all the stages involved in a value chain of a battery, it is critical to identify the battery material supply-disruptive risks and uncertainties, and subsequently to analyze the impacts of the perpetuation of the supply issues on the future market of batteries. In this research study, to contribute to these processes necessary for overcoming the ongoing supply sustainability challenges, the focus is on lithium, nickel, graphite, and cobalt, which are among the battery raw materials with high supply risks. After analyzing and categorizing the driving forces behind the historical and current bottlenecks to their mining production, the regional and global mining production of those battery materials have been predicted for twenty years ahead using three time series forecasting techniques including Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Holt's linear trend, and Holt-Winters’ methods. Forecasting possible future production trends of those battery raw materials is indisputably imperative to resolve planning strategies while dealing with uncertainties and supply risks.

However, as the production and availability of geologic map databases continues to increase, inconsistent data models and the lack of synthesized, national geologic map data at scales appropriate for informed decision making negatively affect the functional integration of geologic map data with other national datasets. The Geologic Map Schema (GeMS) is the publication and archive database standard for geologic map data funded by the U.S. Geological Survey National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, and standardizes the organization and content of a single map database. However, synthesizing multiple databases into a seamless geologic map database creates a different set of challenges and database needs than GeMS was designed to accommodate. The Seamless Integrated Geologic Mapping (SIGMa) extension is designed to expand the capabilities of GeMS by enabling integration of map-based geoscience data. In particular, the SIGMa extension enables capturing a diverse and ever-changing set of map units, produced by many contributors operating independently, and by incremental and noncontiguous assembly and publication. Feature-level metadata fields allow data sources and digital compilation methods to be attributed separately and a relational structure is designed to support the link between data sources and features attributed with multiple data sources. Instead of paragraph-style map-unit descriptions that can be highly inconsistent, SIGMa parses fundamental map-unit attributes, including material, genetic process, and age, into thematically specific fields. The SIGMa extension uses a hierarchical map-unit organization to facilitate a dynamic and evolving, formation-level stratigraphic framework. The hierarchy is developed around geologic provinces that represent temporally restricted geologic events, processes, and settings. Geologic provinces can include magmatic events, depositional settings associated with tectonic processes or stable continental margins, and processes that are actively shaping the modern landscape. A geologic province hierarchy places map units into a geologic context at subregional to continental scales and provides the flexibility to support incremental assembly of the stratigraphy.",NA,U.S. Geological Survey National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program,NA,NA,"KJ Turner, JB Workman, J Colgan, AK Gilmer, ME Berry… - 2022 - pubs.usgs.gov",2022,"Geologic maps are the fundamental building blocks of surface and subsurface three-dimensional geologic framework models of the Earth's crust.

Starting from October 2022, we deployed 86 Smartsolo 5-Hz 3-component seismic nodes for four months in the direct vicinity of the Elgin swarm. By using a combination of deep learning and match filter techniques for event detection, and double-difference relocation method for precise earthquake locations, we obtain up to 100 high-resolution microearthquake locations, as compared with 4 events listed in the USGS catalog for the deployment period. In our improved catalog, we report significantly smaller magnitudes in comparison to those listed in the USGS catalog, with a local magnitude ranging from -2.17 to 2.54 and achieving a magnitude of completeness at -0.20. The relocated catalog outlined a single fault plane of nearly north–south strike and west–dipping, inconsistent with either known fault strikes or the magnetic anomalies in this region. We also determine focal mechanism solutions for selected events in this swarm sequence, which shows mainly strike-slip faulting with nodal planes aligning with the north–south striking seismic cluster. Our relocated catalog can be used to constrain the location of other swarm events outside the nodal recording period and provide a robust benchmark dataset for further analysis of the swarm sequence.",NA,NA,"Elgin and Lugoff, South Carolina, USA",deployment of 86 Smartsolo 5-Hz 3-component seismic nodes; deep learning techniques for event detection; match filter techniques for event detection; double-difference relocation method for precise earthquake locations,"OE Adeboboye, LY Chuang, M Neves, Z Peng, D Frost… - eartharxiv.org",NA,Localized west-dipping seismic structure defines the Elgin–Lugoff Swarm Sequence in South Carolina Page 1 Localized west-dipping seismic structure defines 1 the Elgin–Lugoff Swarm …,https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/7610/download/15723/,5,URL:pdf,NA,"Adeboboye, Oluwaseyifunmi E.; Chuang, Lindsay Y.; Miguel Neves (School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute Of Technology, USA; Université Côte d’Azur, IRD, CNRS, OCA, Géoazur, Sophia Antipolis, France); Peng, Z. h. i. g. a. n. g.; Frost, D. a. n.; Jaumé, Steven C.",8; 863; 922; 382; 564; 1359,"Adeboboye, Oluwaseyifunmi E.; Neves, Miguel; Peng, Zhigang; Frost, Dan; Jaumé, Steven C.; Chuang, Lindsay Y.",Seismological Society of America,563,1,7,5,5,"Parsed field lost existing author 1359 (Chuang, Lindsay Y.)",

An integrated modeling approach is presented to quantify spatiotemporal field-level abstraction volumes. The approach is both demand-driven, using crop growth algorithms and soil moisture to trigger irrigation events, and supply-constrained, using simulated groundwater storage to constrain extraction. The approach uses the SWAT + hydrologic model, with the use of the gwflow subroutine for simulating spatially distributed groundwater storage and flow. The approach is demonstrated for the Mississippi Delta (northwest Mississippi, USA), a region of high groundwater irrigation and groundwater depletion, for the period 2000–2020. The model is corroborated using system responses that constrain both soil moisture and groundwater storage: streamflow, crop yield, crop evapotranspiration, groundwater level changes, and annual abstraction volumes. Results show good agreement for all system responses, with groundwater level changes matching groundwater depletion magnitudes in the central region of the Big Sunflower Watershed. Simulated annual abstraction volumes generally match measured volumes on an average and frequency basis, although an underestimation of 20% occurs for one year (2015), due to the automatic irrigation feature of the model. Therefore, in addition to providing accurate annual volumes of groundwater abstraction for most years, the model can also be used to quantify the volume of excessive irrigation, and hence the volume of groundwater depletion that can be prevented. This modeling approach can be used to estimate historical abstraction rates and predict future changes in groundwater abstraction and storage trends for varying climate and management scenarios.",NA,NA,"Mississippi Delta, USA",integrated modeling approach; SWAT+ hydrologic model; gwflow subroutine,"RT Bailey, S Abbas, N Čerkasova, JG Arnold… - Hydrogeology …, 2025 - Springer",2025,Estimates of groundwater abstraction volumes for irrigation are essential for water management and water supply forecasting.

Daily water-table altitude is used to estimate diffuse and rapid recharge in response to daily precipitation, snowmelt, and evapotranspiration. The model is defined from balance equations, where instead of soil-moisture retention functions defining unsaturated-zone fluxes, fluxes are defined using parameters analogous to the water-residence time in the unsaturated zone. Unsaturated-zone balance equations are coupled at the water table, combining recharge at the water table, the time-varying water-table altitude, and fluxes in the saturated flow regime. The model is applied over a 17-year period at 32 US Geological Survey Climate Response Network wells completed in the unconsolidated Coastal Plain aquifer and fractured-rock aquifers across the DRB. Daily estimates of diffuse and rapid recharge are aggregated over seasons and seasonal characteristics of the frequency and magnitude of rapid recharge are compared across different geologic settings. The fraction of the average seasonally aggregated recharge attributed to rapid recharge (Φ r-rech) at monitoring locations is largely explained by the depth to the water table (DTW) and the geologic setting, which is defined from the geologic age and lithology. Distinctive characteristics of the void space within different geologic settings are hypothesized to influence the occurrence of rapid recharge.

This will increase the demand for raw materials used in batteries, such as graphite. Further, due to geopolitical risk and the need for sustainable sources, graphite mining is also of interest in Europe and nations like Finland. During the concentration and/or refining of ore, an enormous amount of waste is produced due to the low concentration of the desired element. Some of the material of interest ends up in these side streams, as for example, in the tailings. However, the waste can potentially be used as a secondary source of raw materials. In this work the potential processing scenarios of graphite mine tailings were investigated. The studied tailings samples originated from pilot metallurgical test work done in Canada with Aitolampi graphite ore. According to the analysis results, the tailings contain high concentrations of sulfidic sulfur and heavy metals, posing a potential risk of acid mine drainage. In this work, the potential strategies for harmful elements removal were studied and advantages and disadvantages were evaluated. This thesis work included magnetic and gravity separation test work done for tailings samples. Additionally, leaching experiments with varying acid molarity, temperature, and solid-to-liquid ratio were conducted. Based on the results, with a low-intensity magnetic separator, 58–64% of sulfidic sulfur could be recovered. Additionally, the magnetic product is theoretically suitable to be used in sulfuric acid production. Further, with gravity separation, the grade of Ni, Co, Cu, and Zn could be increased by a ratio of two to three. By leaching experiments, the leaching orders of the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite were confirmed. However, the concentrations of Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn in the tailings were too low, and Fe was too high to be economically attractive, so that recovery utilizing only leaching would be economical. This suggests that low grade tailings will still require technological innovations to achieve concentrates suitable for state-of-the-art refining.",Circular economy; graphite; tailings; sulfur; metal recovery,BATCircle 2.0 project; Geological Survey of Finland; Academy of Finland,Finland,magnetic separation; gravity separation; leaching experiments,SJ Rytkönen - 2022 - repository.tudelft.nl,2022,The electrification of the world and the green transition are expected to increase the demand for energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries.

Many of these are by-products, often considered critical because their production responds weakly to prices and is instead tied to the economics of the host mineral. We present a model of prices and production for jointly produced commodities that accounts for interconnectivity between host and by-product markets at the mine level. We demonstrate this method using the copper–cobalt–nickel system, in which approximately 99% of cobalt is a by-product of copper or nickel mining. Our results show that the model more accurately captures the economic benefits of diversified mine outputs than previous approaches. Furthermore, changes in demand drivers for any two commodities produce non-linear effects on production and price. We challenge the prior best-practice assumption that cobalt cannot impact the copper or nickel markets. Recognizing the importance of both copper and cobalt for future electrification, we emphasize that incentivizing the copper industry to reduce cobalt supply risks could inadvertently undermine copper supply.",NA,NA,NA,4D supply and demand functions; Bayesian optimization; historical modeling,"J Ryter, K Bhuwalka, R Roth, E Olivetti… - Nature …, 2025 - nature.com",2025,"Demand for many of the metals used in the energy transition is expected to grow rapidly.

The Neoproterozoic Borborema Province presents direct linkage to several orogenic belts along western Gondwana, but its crustal evolution is contentious resulting in a range of geological models. In the region, exotic terranes that might have been docked via thrust- and strike slip structures preserve pre-Gondwana events that provide glimpses for the evolution of orogenic systems more generally. A total of 201 Sm Nd analysis of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic Alto Moxotó Terrane, central Borborema Province reveals source ages in granitic, mafic and metasedimentary rocks that are mostly Paleoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic, which contrast with the adjacent terranes. The successive juvenile inputs and crustal reworking from Neoarchean ( ca. 2.6 Ga) to mid-Paleoproterozoic ( ca. 2.1 Ga) diverge with the early to late Neoproterozoic dominant crust of the neighboring blocks. 3D geophysical modelling highlights the unique signature of the Alto Moxotó Terrane compared to these blocks, including: i) K-poor and Th-rich crust and ii) higher gravity gradients when compared with the bordering lithospheric record, both in gamma-spectrometric and gravimetric maps. Moreover, prominent magnetic anomalies in all magnetometric maps coincide with the major shear zones, including previously proposed terrane boundaries, suggesting that they might represent cryptic or unmapped suture zones.

In order to figure out the role of granites in the formation of the Zhuxi deposit, textures and compositions of apatites in the Zhuxi granites were investigated. Granites related to the Zhuxi W-Cu deposit include biotite granite, muscovite granite, and granite porphyry. Apatites in these granites are named Group A, Group B (core – Group B1; rim – Group B2), and Group C, respectively. Along this sequence, geochemical characteristics of apatites show gradual enrichment of total rare earth elements (ΣREE), high-field strength elements (HFSE; Th, U, Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf), as well as ore-forming element W, and depletion of Sr. Meanwhile, Ga content in these apatites consecutively increased, indicating the reduction of oxygen fugacity in the Zhuxi magmatic system. Non-chondritic Y/Ho (mostly > 34) and Zr/Hf (broadly < 5) ratios in Group C apatite reflect the high volume of fluids interacted with the magma of the most evolved granite porphyry. Constant high F contents (3.4–4.4 wt%) in all apatite samples show abundant F in the Zhuxi magmas, which played an important role in the formation of the Zhuxi deposit in terms of facilitating W enrichment in magma and exsolution of W into hydrothermal fluids.

First, rock descriptions, geological ages, lithostratigraphic and lithodemic information, and other long-form text data are translated to numerical vectors, i.e., a word embedding, using a geoscience language model. Network analysis of word associations, nearest neighbors, and principal component analysis are then used to extract meaningful semantic relationships between rock types. We further demonstrate using simple Naive Bayes classifiers and the area under receiver operating characteristics plots (AUC) how word vectors can be used to: (1) predict the locations of “pegmatitic” (AUC = 0.962) and “alkalic” (AUC = 0.938) rocks; (2) predict mineral potential for Mississippi-Valley-type (AUC = 0.868) and clastic-dominated (AUC = 0.809) Zn-Pb deposits; and (3) search geoscientific text data for analogues of the giant Mount Isa clastic-dominated Zn-Pb deposit using the cosine similarities between word vectors.

Therefore, Li mineralization theory must be further developed to realize the comprehensive utilization of bauxite resources. The Qinyuan Li–rich bauxite is formed in the Benxi Epoch of the Late Carboniferous and its parent rock is the underlying Ordovician limestone. In this study, the methods of stepwise extraction and element geochemical are utilized to discuss the occurrence state and sedimentary environment of Li in Qinyuan bauxite, respectively. Based on the differences in element composition, the Qinyuan Li–rich bauxite sequence can be divided into clay rocks, bauxitic clays, iron–rich clays, and bauxite from the bottom to the top. The Li content of the Qinyuan bauxite samples is highest in clay rocks (averaging 431 µg/g), followed by bauxitic clays (averaging 288 µg/g), bauxite (averaging 252 µg/g), and iron–rich clays (averaging 202 µg/g). The main mineral compositions of these samples are diaspore, calcite, anatase, pyrite, siderite, kaolinite, and illite. Among them, the Li content is positively correlated with clay mineral contents (R² = 0.71), indicating that clay minerals are the main Li–rich minerals. More specifically, the clay mineral in bauxitic clays, bauxite, and iron–rich clays are kaolinite, and the positive correlation between Li and kaolinite (R² = 0.46) indicates that kaolinite is the main Li–rich mineral. Nevertheless, the clay minerals in clay rocks are kaolinite and illite, and the correlation between Li and illite (R² = 0.54) is higher than kaolinite (R² = 0.10), indicating that Li is preferentially enriched in illite when kaolinite and illite coexist. It was found that the majority (higher than 99 %) of Li is hosted in the vacant sites of Si–O tetrahedral layers and the Al–O dioctahedral layers of illite and kaolinite to compensate the positive charge deficit caused by replacement of Si4+ and Al3+ in the tetrahedral and dioctahedral layers of clay minerals, respectively. Furthermore, the content ratios between typical elements with varied migration–deposition properties can indicate the depositional environment of Li–rich bauxite. Among them, MgO/Al2O3 and Rb/K (range from 1.3 × 10 -3 to 7.36 × 10 -2 and 3 × 10 -4 to 3.44 × 10 -2 in samples, respectively) can indicate sedimentary environment.

Sr/Cu, CIA, and C value (range from 3.53 to 48.2, 93.8 to 99.9, and 0.43 to 7.29 in samples, respectively) can indicate paleoclimate. The results show that the Qinyuan bauxite possibly formed in the hot, humid (Sr/Cu > 5, CIA = 85–100, and C value > 0.8), and dysoxic–anoxic (Th/U = 2–7, V/Cr = 2–4.25, and V/(V + Ni) = 0.46–0.84) marine–continental transitional (MgO/Al2O3 = 0.01–0.1 and Rb/K = 4 × 10 -3 –6 × 10 -3) environment.",lithium; bauxite; geochemistry; sedimentary environment,NA,"Qinyuan County, Shanxi, China",stepwise extraction; element geochemical analysis,"S Zhang, X Liu, F Zhao, D Liu, Y Zou, W Zhang… - Journal of Geochemical …, 2021 - Elsevier",2021,"Karst bauxite resources are widespread in the Shanxi Province, accounting for the richest bauxite resources in China.

We present field observations, uranium-lead (U–Pb) monazite and titanite geochronology, carbon (C) and sulfur (S) stable isotope geochemistry, and graphite Raman spectroscopy data from this deposit that support a new model of flake graphite ore genesis in high-grade metamorphic environments. The Graphite Creek deposit is within the second sillimanite metamorphic zone of the Kigluaik Mountains gneiss dome. Flake graphite, hosted in sillimanite-gneiss and quartz-biotite paragneiss, occurs as disseminations and in sets of very high grade (up to 50 wt.% graphite), semi-massive to massive graphite lenses 0.2 to 1 m wide containing quartz, sillimanite, inclusions of garnet porphyroblasts, K-feldspar, and tourmaline. Restitic garnet, sillimanite, graphite, and biotite accumulations indicate a high degree of anatexis and melt loss. Strong yttrium depletion in monazite, high europium ratios (Eu/Eu*), and excursions of high strontium and thorium concentrations are consistent with biotite dehydration melting. Monazite and titanite U–Pb ages record peak metamorphism from ~ 97 to 92 million years ago (Ma) and a retrograde event at ~ 85 Ma. Raman spectroscopy confirms the presence of carbonaceous material and highly ordered, crystalline graphite. Graphite δ 13 C VPDB values of −30 to −12‰ and pyrrhotite δ 34 S VCDT values of −14 to 10‰ are consistent with derivation from organic carbon and sulfur in sedimentary rocks, respectively. These data collectively suggest that formation of massive graphite lenses occurred approximately synchronously with high-temperature metamorphism and anatexis of a highly carbonaceous pelitic protolith. Melt extraction and fluid release associated with anatexis were likely crucial for concentrating graphite.

The basin experienced multiple-stage complex tectonic movements, whose influences on burial, thermal maturation and gas generation histories in different areas are poorly understood. Based on a detailed study of the denudation stages, strata thickness, and thermal history of the basin, burial and thermal maturation histories of seven wells in different areas were modelled using PetroMod software. Due to the high maturity of the WL shale, a low-maturity Silurian Polish Llandovery shale was used for gold tube closed-system pyrolysis experiments to obtain kinetic parameters for evaluating methane generation history. The Polish shale was selected due to its depositional age, sedimentary environment and organic type, which are similar to the WL shale. The burial history of the WL shale can be divided into five stages: I. Early to Middle Silurian rapid burial; II. Caledonian uplift and denudation; III. Permian to Triassic sustained burial and denudation; IV. sustained burial since the Late Triassic; and V. Late Cretaceous to present sustained uplift and denudation. The thermal maturity of the WL shale in all wells increased with burial depth during stage IV. In addition, high calculated reflectance increments in wells JY1 and N201 during stage III occurred due to the relatively high basal heat flow and deep burial depth, resulting in higher current thermal maturities than in the other wells. The late Permian–Early Triassic and the Middle Jurassic–Early (or Late) Cretaceous were the key methane generation periods for wells JY1 and N201. In contrast, the other five wells had a single methane generation stage, mainly determined by burial and thermal maturation processes. The time of uplift and the amount of denudation during stage V, the current burial depth, the development of faults and fractures, high proportion of retention and the seal capacity of the overlying caprock are key factors for shale gas preservation.
