Key questions regarding provenance, pathways of minerals to deposit sites, and relations to geologic features remain unexplained. As part of a national effort to collect data over regions prospective for critical minerals, the first public high-resolution aeroradiometric survey over the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain was conducted over Quaternary sediments in South Carolina. The new data provide an unprecedented view of potential deposits by imaging Th-bearing minerals in the heavy mineral assemblage. Sand ridges show the highest radiometric Th values with localized, linear anomalies, especially along the shoreface and in areas reworked by multiple processes and/or during multiple episodes. Estuarine areas with finer-grained sediments show lower, distributed Th anomalies. Th values averaged over geologic unit areas are similar for both environments, suggesting that heavy minerals are present but have not been locally concentrated in the lower-energy estuarine environments. Radiometric K highlights immature minerals such as mica and potassium feldspar. K is elevated within shallow sediments younger than ca. 130 ka, an attribute that persists in regional data from northern South Carolina to northern Florida. Both K and Th are elevated over the floodplains of the Santee River and other rivers with headwaters in the igneous and metamorphic Piedmont Terrane. The persistence of K anomalies for distances of more than 100 km from the Santee River floodplain suggests that heavy minerals are delivered from the Piedmont to offshore areas by major rivers, transported along the coast by the longshore current, and redeposited onshore by marine processes.",NA,NA,U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain,high-resolution aeroradiometric survey,NA,Parent,NA,NA,NA,U.S. Geological Survey,22,22,0,Anjana K.

The Wet Mountains are known for thorium and REE mineralization associated with failed rift-related, Ediacaran-Ordovician alkaline intrusions and veins. Structural field data indicate that alkaline dikes and mineralized veins are controlled by a system of northwest-striking, high-angle faults and tension fractures formed in a 040Â°-directed extensional regime. Magnetic and surface expressions of Democrat Creek and McClure Mountain complexes show tectonic elongation toward âˆ¼045Â°, consistent with NE-directed extension. Magnetic data also suggest the existence of a fourth, previously unrecognized mafic-ultramafic complex of inferred Cambrian age with a similar elongated orientation. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) 208 Pb/ 232 Th analysis of low-uranium zircon from carbonatite dikes and in situ 206 Pb/ 238 U LA-ICP-MS analysis of monazite in mineralized dikes yielded 465 Â± 18 Ma and 489 Â± 33 Ma ages, respectively. These ages are consistent with the expected age based on slightly older, cross-cut syenite dikes and the hypothesized Ordovician end to failed rift-related magmatism. The Ediacaran-Ordovician age of alkaline magmatic rocks and the associated northeast-directed extension direction are similar to those of the along-strike, Ediacaran-Cambrian Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen. Therefore, the failed rift system in the Wet Mountains is interpreted to be a northwestern continuation of the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen with carbonatite magmatism and thorium/REE mineralization representing late intrusive phases.",NA,NA,"Wet Mountains, Colorado",field methods; geophysical methods; U-Th-Pb isotope methods; Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS),"USGS data release - Gravity data in the Wet Mountains area, southcentral Colorado, 2021 to 2022; USGS data release - Magnetic susceptibility measurements in the Wet Mountains, Colorado, 2021 to 2022; USGS data release - Airborne magnetic and radiometric survey of the Wet Mountains and surrounding region, Custer and Fremont Counties, south-central Colorado, 2021",Parent,NA,NA,NA,U.S. Geological Survey,37,37,0,Benjamin Patrick Magnin; Yvette Kuiper; Eric D.
