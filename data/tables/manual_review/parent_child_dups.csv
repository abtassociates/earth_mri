A renewed interest in critical minerals in the US and the world has become the focus of research in understanding ore formation, mineral-resource potential and ore production of these important mineral deposits. Alkaline-igneous rocks, including carbonatites, are known for their associated critical minerals deposits. The North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt is one such area known for gold, molybdenum, rare earth elements (REEs) and critical minerals deposits associated with Eocene–Miocene (45.6–22.8 Ma) alkaline-igneous rocks and carbonatites. The belt extends southward from Alaska and British Columbia into New Mexico and eastern Mexico. Gold, molybdenum and critical minerals such as REEs, tellurium, fluorine, zirconium and niobium have been found and locally exploited along this belt. In New Mexico (the focus of this paper), the belt extends southward from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the Cornudas Mountains, in the northern Trans-Pecos alkaline belt. The mineral deposits in the North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt are controlled by composition and source of alkaline magmas, regional and local structures and development of multiple hydrothermal systems during the transition from Laramide compression (75–40 Ma) to Rio Grande rift extension (28–5 Ma). Three predominant types of mineral deposits are found in the North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt: (1) alkalic-type epithermal gold; (2) Climax-type porphyry molybdenum; and (3) magmatic REE deposits (including veins and breccia deposits in adjacent host rocks). A fourth deposit type, small alkalic porphyry copper–gold deposits, is found in a few districts. Many of the mineral deposits in this belt formed at or after peak activity of a local magmatic cycle. Magmas and sulfur were derived from melting of the lower crust to upper mantle (as indicated by isotopic data from several deposits) resulting in the diversity of mineral deposits in the southern North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt. Most of the magmatic REE deposits occurred during the transitional period (40–28 Ma), whereas the Climax-type porphyry molybdenum deposits occurred mostly at the beginning of rifting (25–24 Ma). The alkali-epithermal gold and small alkalic porphyry deposits occurred at the end of the Laramide orogeny and during the transitional period before rifting. Most alkalic-type epithermal gold deposits in New Mexico are found in hydrothermal breccia pipes and skarns with anomalous, but uneconomic concentrations of REEs and tellurium. Alkalic-type epithermal and alkalic porphyry copper–gold deposits in New Mexico are found in the Ortiz Mountains in Santa Fe County (Carache Canyon, Lucas Canyon). Many districts in the belt have future critical minerals potential. Tellurium is found at Cripple Creek, Colorado and Organ Mountains, New Mexico. Tungsten was locally produced in the past from two of these gold deposits (Elizabethtown and White Oaks) and is found in the Ortiz Mountains deposits. The Climax-type molybdenum deposits, including the Questa deposit, contain anomalous, but uneconomic, concentrations of beryllium and fluorite. The magmatic REE deposits in Laughlin Peak, Gallinas, Capitan and Cornudas mountains, New Mexico, generally contain anomalous, but uneconomic, concentrations of zircon, niobium, fluorite and gold, and generally low tellurium, tungsten and beryllium concentrations. The magmatic REE deposits in the Gallinas Mountains are among the highest ranked deposits for economic potential for REEs in New Mexico; some samples contain as much as 8% total REEs. Some samples in the Cornudas Mountains contain as much as 3110 ppm total REEs, mostly in eudialyte. A mineral concentrate of the REE-bearing minerals (eudialyte, zircon, monazite, bastnäsite, calcio-catapleiite, vitusite, roumaite, xenotime) could be obtained after mining by magnetic separation and REEs could be leached from that concentrate.; Critical minerals are non-fuel mineral commodities that are essential to the economic and national security of the United States and many other countries, mostly imported into the US …",,US Geological Survey (USGS) National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program; New Mexico Geological Society; New Mexico Tech Brightstar Scholarship; Society of Economic Geology,North American Cordilleran alkaline-igneous belt,,,Geological Society of London (Lyell Collection),2025,VT McLemore; N Iverson; EJ Owen,"VT McLemore, N Iverson, EJ Owen… - Geological Society …, 2025 - lyellcollection.org","Critical minerals are non-fuel mineral commodities that are essential to the economic and national security of the United States and many other countries, mostly imported into the US …",,3; 6,FromColumns,10.1144/SP551-2024-85,"McLemore, Virginia T.; Iverson, N.; Owen, Evan J.",9; 4

We use new high-resolution aeromagnetic data, previous borehole sample information, and reprocessed seismic reflection profiles to image subsurface structures and evaluate recent fault activity within the Charleston seismic zone, the associated Mesozoic South Georgia rift basin, and surrounds. The new aeromagnetic data provide an unprecedented view of buried basement structures. NE- and NW-trending lineaments of various lengths throughout the survey area are interpreted as Paleozoic orogenic structures and Mesozoic dikes, respectively. Within the rift basin, 15- to 20-km long ESE-trending lineaments are associated with faults in pre-Cretaceous strata of the reflection data and are interpreted as Mesozoic rift structures. Various intersections and terminations of interpreted faults suggest rift-related reactivation of Paleozoic faults and corresponding inheritance for Mesozoic structures. The reflection data show that several Paleozoic and Mesozoic faults are associated with deformation in Cretaceous and younger sediments, suggesting reactivation in the more recent passive margin setting. Two of these faults, one NE-striking and one ESE-striking, are coincident with surficial landforms, suggesting Quaternary slip; the ESE-striking fault is also well-aligned with a plan-view offset in modern seismicity. A favorable orientation for reverse motion on ESE-striking Mesozoic faults, a possible sub-basin, and potentially weakened lithosphere are failed rift basin features that may influence intraplate seismicity within the Charleston seismic zone.; The delineation of faults that pose seismic risk in intraplate seismic zones and the mapping of features associated with failed rift basins can help our understanding of links between the …",,,"Charleston, South Carolina seismic zone",high-resolution aeromagnetic data; borehole sample information; reprocessed seismic reflection profiles,,American Geophysical Union (via Wiley),2023,AK Shah; TL Pratt; JW Horton Jr,"AK Shah, TL Pratt, JW Horton Jr - Geochemistry, Geophysics …, 2023 - Wiley Online Library",The delineation of faults that pose seismic risk in intraplate seismic zones and the mapping of features associated with failed rift basins can help our understanding of links between the …,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2022GC010803,4,FromColumns,10.1029/2022GC010803,"Shah, A.

The Wet Mountains are known for thorium and REE mineralization associated with failed rift-related, Ediacaran-Ordovician alkaline intrusions and veins. Structural field data indicate that alkaline dikes and mineralized veins are controlled by a system of northwest-striking, high-angle faults and tension fractures formed in a 040°-directed extensional regime. Magnetic and surface expressions of Democrat Creek and McClure Mountain complexes show tectonic elongation toward ∼045°, consistent with NE-directed extension. Magnetic data also suggest the existence of a fourth, previously unrecognized mafic-ultramafic complex of inferred Cambrian age with a similar elongated orientation. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) 208 Pb/ 232 Th analysis of low-uranium zircon from carbonatite dikes and in situ 206 Pb/ 238 U LA-ICP-MS analysis of monazite in mineralized dikes yielded 465 ± 18 Ma and 489 ± 33 Ma ages, respectively. These ages are consistent with the expected age based on slightly older, cross-cut syenite dikes and the hypothesized Ordovician end to failed rift-related magmatism. The Ediacaran-Ordovician age of alkaline magmatic rocks and the associated northeast-directed extension direction are similar to those of the along-strike, Ediacaran-Cambrian Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen. Therefore, the failed rift system in the Wet Mountains is interpreted to be a northwestern continuation of the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen with carbonatite magmatism and thorium/REE mineralization representing late intrusive phases.; Abstract Structures associated with Ediacaran‐Ordovician alkaline magmatism and the timing of rare earth element (REE) mineralization in the Wet Mountains, CO, were analyzed …",,,"Wet Mountains, Colorado",field methods; geophysical methods; U-Th-Pb isotope methods; Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS),"USGS data release - Gravity data in the Wet Mountains area, southcentral Colorado, 2021 to 2022; USGS data release - Magnetic susceptibility measurements in the Wet Mountains, Colorado, 2021 to 2022; USGS data release - Airborne magnetic and radiometric survey of the Wet Mountains and surrounding region, Custer and Fremont Counties, south-central Colorado, 2021",American Geophysical Union (via Wiley),2023,BP Magnin; YD Kuiper; ED Anderson,"BP Magnin, YD Kuiper, ED Anderson - Tectonics, 2023 - Wiley Online Library","Abstract Structures associated with Ediacaran‐Ordovician alkaline magmatism and the timing of rare earth element (REE) mineralization in the Wet Mountains, CO, were analyzed …",https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2022TC007674,2; 1,FromColumns,10.1029/2022TC007674,"Magnin, B.

EarthMRI can inform strategies to ensure secure and reliable domestic critical mineral supplies for the United States as mandated by Executive Order 13817 and the Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 (Public Law 117–58, 135 Stat. 529). Earth MRI is a collaborative effort between the USGS and the State geological surveys as represented by the Association of American State Geologists to identify, prioritize, and acquire new geoscience data for geographic areas, or focus areas, across the Nation that have potential to host critical mineral resources. Mapping of focus areas was based on a framework of mineral systems and their associated mineral deposit types that could possibly host critical minerals. Using readily available geologic, geophysical, geochemical, and mineral deposit data, teams of USGS scientists worked with representatives of State geological surveys in a series of workshops to outline focus areas that contain evidence of key features for one or more mineral systems. These areas can be used to guide future efforts to collect new geologic, geophysical, geochemical, and topographic data that focus on critical minerals through Earth MRI.; NA",,,Geoscience data for critical mineral resources; United States,geologic data; geophysical data; geochemical data; mineral deposit data; geologic mapping; geophysical data analysis; geochemical data analysis; workshops; geologic data; geophysical data; geochemical data; mineral deposit data; workshops; geologic mapping; geophysical data analysis; geochemical data analysis; mineral deposit data analysis,,U.S. Geological Survey,2023,"Hammarstrom, J.M.; Kreiner, D.C.; Dicken, C.L.; Woodruff, L.G.","JM Hammarstrom, DC Kreiner, CL Dicken, LG Woodruff - 2023 - pubs.usgs.gov","The US Geological Survey (USGS) launched the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI) to modernize the surface and subsurface geologic mapping of the United States, with a …",https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2023/3007/fs20233007.pdf,5; 2; 10; 4; 6,URL:html,10.3133/fs20233007,"Hammarstrom, J.

Coordinated with these efforts are programs supporting geologic mapping and airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) surveys that yield detailed surface topographic models of the terrain over the same regions spanned by the geophysical surveys. The collaboration leverages resources from the USGS and DOE to acquire large regional datasets that will provide fundamental data necessary to map surface and subsurface geology and structure to benefit mineral and resource program objectives of both agencies. Such regionally uniform datasets are important for geothermal research to assist in identifying geologically favorable settings and as invaluable inputs in predictive models targeting undiscovered resources that use knowledge-driven (e.g., play fairway analysis) or data-driven approaches (e.g., machine-learning methods) to reduce risk associated with resource exploration. These data will also serve a wide range of other related activities from hazard (earthquake, volcano, landslide, environmental) and resource (water, mineral, energy) studies, to mapping and land management. Surveys were conducted in two areas that were selected because they host substantial geothermal and mineral potential in California and Nevada. The data will aid several ongoing USGS and DOE projects aimed at characterizing geothermal and mineral systems, understanding the factors controlling their occurrence, and improving future national resource assessments. The first of these surveys (referred to as GeoDAWN) was collected over northern and western Nevada and eastern California and spans areas of major resource potential associated with the Walker Lane and western Great Basin. This includes Clayton Valley, which hosts substantial lithium brine and clay resources, and the Humboldt Mafic Complex, which constitutes a potentially important resource of critical minerals (including cobalt, rare earth elements, platinum group elements, iron, chromium, nickel, and copper). The second survey area (referred to as GeoFlight) is focused over the Salton Trough in southern California that contains some of the largest and hottest known hydrothermal systems in the world, as well as a substantial lithium brine resource that could potentially meet the nation’s lithium demand for electric vehicles. Data from both surveys will be made publicly available through USGS publications and online data repositories. Future efforts under this collaboration are presently being evaluated and may involve acquisition of other data sets such as airborne gravity, electromagnetic or hyperspectral data to address research targets.; The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) are collaborating to acquire high-resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric data to support geologic and geophysical mapping and modeling that will assist geothermal and critical mineral studies.

DGGS geologists collected 549 structure measurements, discussed by section below based on the planar feature type, and where appropriate, subdivided by host units. The majority are metamorphic foliations and fold-axial planes. Limited measurements of linear features, such as fold axes, stretched minerals, and intersections lineations, are recorded where observed. Measurements of bedding, fault surfaces, joint surfaces, and vein walls are also limited. Complete field descriptions and locations for station numbers cited can be found in Naibert and others (2020b). Our new geologic mapping (Twelker and others, 2021) extensively revises the known extent of metamorphic terrane boundaries, igneous rocks, and faults. Analysis of the new structural data was undertaken to test prior workers’ metamorphic history and tectonic interpretations for the region, and it provides insights into local structural features within the context of their host unit.",Allochthon; Amphibolite; Ar-Ar; DGGS; Earth MRI; Gneiss; Klondike Assemblage; Ladue River; Lake George Assemblage; Mississippian; Mt.

The complex is latest Cretaceous (ca. 67 Ma) in age and consists of two recognized intrusive suites or groups: (1) an alkalic group comprising quartz-poor lithologies (monzonite, syenite, alkali-feldspar syenite) and (2) a slightly younger, sub-alkalic group comprising quartz-rich lithologies (granite and quartz monzonite). Ilmenite and magnetite compositions of the alkalic rocks indicate magmatic oxidation states in the vicinity of the fayalite-quartz-magnetite (FQM) buffer; in contrast, data for the quartz-rich suite indicates conditions much more oxidized than the FQM buffer. Both groups typically contain diopsidic clinopyroxene, biotite, and amphibole, and the most mafic of the alkalic group contains olivine or iddingsite. Microprobe studies show that amphibole, biotite, and feldspar compositions vary according to both primary magmatic and secondary, post-magmatic processes or alteration.",Alteration Products; CIPW Norms; Earth MRI; Feldspar; Fortymile Mining District; Geochemical Data; Geologic; Geology; Granite; Igneous; Magnetite; Microprobe Analysis; Mineral Assessment; Mineral Composition; Mineral Deposit; Mineral Exploration; Mineral Localities; Mineral Prospect; Mineral Resources; Mineralogy; Minerals; Monazite; Niobium; Petrology; Plagioclase; Plutonic; Prehnite; Quartz; Rare Earth Elements; Ree; Replacement; Resources; Rhyolite; Rocks; Tanacross; Taylor Highway; Thin Section; Thorium; Uranium; Mount Fairplay; igneous complex; alkalic rocks; sub-alkalic rocks; rare earth elements; hydrothermal alteration,Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI),eastern Interior Alaska,"major-, minor-, and trace-element analyses; examination of thin sections; Energy-dispersive electron probe microanalysis (EDS-EPMA)",pir2020_001-sample-location-details.csv,Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys,2020,"Rainer J.
