In order to figure out the role of granites in the formation of the Zhuxi deposit, textures and compositions of apatites in the Zhuxi granites were investigated. Granites related to the Zhuxi W-Cu deposit include biotite granite, muscovite granite, and granite porphyry. Apatites in these granites are named Group A, Group B (core â€“ Group B1; rim â€“ Group B2), and Group C, respectively. Along this sequence, geochemical characteristics of apatites show gradual enrichment of total rare earth elements (Î£REE), high-field strength elements (HFSE; Th, U, Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf), as well as ore-forming element W, and depletion of Sr. Meanwhile, Ga content in these apatites consecutively increased, indicating the reduction of oxygen fugacity in the Zhuxi magmatic system. Non-chondritic Y/Ho (mostlyâ€¯>â€¯34) and Zr/Hf (broadlyâ€¯<â€¯5) ratios in Group C apatite reflect the high volume of fluids interacted with the magma of the most evolved granite porphyry. Constant high F contents (3.4â€“4.4â€¯wt%) in all apatite samples show abundant F in the Zhuxi magmas, which played an important role in the formation of the Zhuxi deposit in terms of facilitating W enrichment in magma and exsolution of W into hydrothermal fluids. The Zhuxi granites formed at ca. 153â€¯Ma when South China Block was in an extensional tectonic setting, and the granite porphyry is the most potential intrusion to cause the mineralization of the Zhuxi deposit.",apatite; granites; W-Cu deposit; geochemistry; mineralization,NA,"Zhuxi, China",cathodoluminescence imaging; back-scattered electron imaging; geochemical analysis,"CN Mercer, KE Watts, J Gross - Ore Geology Reviews, 2020 - Elsevier",2020,"The southeast Missouri iron metallogenic province contains a remarkable wealth of historically important Fe, Cu, Au, and rare earth element (REE) deposits including the Pea â€¦",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0169136818308394,2,URL:html,NA,NA,785,"Mercer, C N",Ore Geology Reviews,158,7,0

However, the descriptive information that forms the basis for a preferred map interpretation is typically stored in geological map databases as unstructured text data that are difficult to use in practice. Herein we apply natural language processing (NLP) to geoscientific text data from Canada, the U.S., and Australia to address that knowledge gap. First, rock descriptions, geological ages, lithostratigraphic and lithodemic information, and other long-form text data are translated to numerical vectors, i.e., a word embedding, using a geoscience language model. Network analysis of word associations, nearest neighbors, and principal component analysis are then used to extract meaningful semantic relationships between rock types.

Therefore, Li mineralization theory must be further developed to realize the comprehensive utilization of bauxite resources. The Qinyuan Liâ€“rich bauxite is formed in the Benxi Epoch of the Late Carboniferous and its parent rock is the underlying Ordovician limestone. In this study, the methods of stepwise extraction and element geochemical are utilized to discuss the occurrence state and sedimentary environment of Li in Qinyuan bauxite, respectively. Based on the differences in element composition, the Qinyuan Liâ€“rich bauxite sequence can be divided into clay rocks, bauxitic clays, ironâ€“rich clays, and bauxite from the bottom to the top. The Li content of the Qinyuan bauxite samples is highest in clay rocks (averaging 431 Âµg/g), followed by bauxitic clays (averaging 288 Âµg/g), bauxite (averaging 252 Âµg/g), and ironâ€“rich clays (averaging 202 Âµg/g). The main mineral compositions of these samples are diaspore, calcite, anatase, pyrite, siderite, kaolinite, and illite. Among them, the Li content is positively correlated with clay mineral contents (RÂ² = 0.71), indicating that clay minerals are the main Liâ€“rich minerals. More specifically, the clay mineral in bauxitic clays, bauxite, and ironâ€“rich clays are kaolinite, and the positive correlation between Li and kaolinite (RÂ² = 0.46) indicates that kaolinite is the main Liâ€“rich mineral. Nevertheless, the clay minerals in clay rocks are kaolinite and illite, and the correlation between Li and illite (RÂ² = 0.54) is higher than kaolinite (RÂ² = 0.10), indicating that Li is preferentially enriched in illite when kaolinite and illite coexist. It was found that the majority (higher than 99 %) of Li is hosted in the vacant sites of Siâ€“O tetrahedral layers and the Alâ€“O dioctahedral layers of illite and kaolinite to compensate the positive charge deficit caused by replacement of Si4+ and Al3+ in the tetrahedral and dioctahedral layers of clay minerals, respectively. Furthermore, the content ratios between typical elements with varied migrationâ€“deposition properties can indicate the depositional environment of Liâ€“rich bauxite. Among them, MgO/Al2O3 and Rb/K (range from 1.3 Ã— 10 -3 to 7.36 Ã— 10 -2 and 3 Ã— 10 -4 to 3.44 Ã— 10 -2 in samples, respectively) can indicate sedimentary environment. Th/U, V/Cr, and V/(V + Ni) (range from 0.45 to 3.73, 0.85 to 3.54, and 0.27 to 0.89 in samples, respectively) can indicate the paleoâ€“redox conditions. Sr/Cu, CIA, and C value (range from 3.53 to 48.2, 93.8 to 99.9, and 0.43 to 7.29 in samples, respectively) can indicate paleoclimate. The results show that the Qinyuan bauxite possibly formed in the hot, humid (Sr/Cu > 5, CIA = 85â€“100, and C value > 0.8), and dysoxicâ€“anoxic (Th/U = 2â€“7, V/Cr = 2â€“4.25, and V/(V + Ni) = 0.46â€“0.84) marineâ€“continental transitional (MgO/Al2O3 = 0.01â€“0.1 and Rb/K = 4 Ã— 10 -3 â€“6 Ã— 10 -3) environment.",lithium; bauxite; geochemistry; sedimentary environment,NA,"Qinyuan County, Shanxi, China",stepwise extraction; element geochemical analysis,"S Zhang, X Liu, F Zhao, D Liu, Y Zou, W Zhangâ€¦ - Journal of Geochemical â€¦, 2021 - Elsevier",2021,"Karst bauxite resources are widespread in the Shanxi Province, accounting for the richest bauxite resources in China.

We present field observations, uranium-lead (Uâ€“Pb) monazite and titanite geochronology, carbon (C) and sulfur (S) stable isotope geochemistry, and graphite Raman spectroscopy data from this deposit that support a new model of flake graphite ore genesis in high-grade metamorphic environments. The Graphite Creek deposit is within the second sillimanite metamorphic zone of the Kigluaik Mountains gneiss dome. Flake graphite, hosted in sillimanite-gneiss and quartz-biotite paragneiss, occurs as disseminations and in sets of very high grade (up to 50 wt.% graphite), semi-massive to massive graphite lenses 0.2 to 1 m wide containing quartz, sillimanite, inclusions of garnet porphyroblasts, K-feldspar, and tourmaline. Restitic garnet, sillimanite, graphite, and biotite accumulations indicate a high degree of anatexis and melt loss. Strong yttrium depletion in monazite, high europium ratios (Eu/Eu*), and excursions of high strontium and thorium concentrations are consistent with biotite dehydration melting. Monazite and titanite Uâ€“Pb ages record peak metamorphism from ~ 97 to 92 million years ago (Ma) and a retrograde event at ~ 85 Ma. Raman spectroscopy confirms the presence of carbonaceous material and highly ordered, crystalline graphite. Graphite Î´ 13 C VPDB values of âˆ’30 to âˆ’12â€° and pyrrhotite Î´ 34 S VCDT values of âˆ’14 to 10â€° are consistent with derivation from organic carbon and sulfur in sedimentary rocks, respectively. These data collectively suggest that formation of massive graphite lenses occurred approximately synchronously with high-temperature metamorphism and anatexis of a highly carbonaceous pelitic protolith. Melt extraction and fluid release associated with anatexis were likely crucial for concentrating graphite.

The basin experienced multiple-stage complex tectonic movements, whose influences on burial, thermal maturation and gas generation histories in different areas are poorly understood. Based on a detailed study of the denudation stages, strata thickness, and thermal history of the basin, burial and thermal maturation histories of seven wells in different areas were modelled using PetroMod software. Due to the high maturity of the WL shale, a low-maturity Silurian Polish Llandovery shale was used for gold tube closed-system pyrolysis experiments to obtain kinetic parameters for evaluating methane generation history. The Polish shale was selected due to its depositional age, sedimentary environment and organic type, which are similar to the WL shale. The burial history of the WL shale can be divided into five stages: I. Early to Middle Silurian rapid burial; II. Caledonian uplift and denudation; III. Permian to Triassic sustained burial and denudation; IV. sustained burial since the Late Triassic; and V. Late Cretaceous to present sustained uplift and denudation. The thermal maturity of the WL shale in all wells increased with burial depth during stage IV. In addition, high calculated reflectance increments in wells JY1 and N201 during stage III occurred due to the relatively high basal heat flow and deep burial depth, resulting in higher current thermal maturities than in the other wells. The late Permianâ€“Early Triassic and the Middle Jurassicâ€“Early (or Late) Cretaceous were the key methane generation periods for wells JY1 and N201. In contrast, the other five wells had a single methane generation stage, mainly determined by burial and thermal maturation processes. The time of uplift and the amount of denudation during stage V, the current burial depth, the development of faults and fractures, high proportion of retention and the seal capacity of the overlying caprock are key factors for shale gas preservation.
