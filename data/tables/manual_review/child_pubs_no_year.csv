DGGS geologists collected 549 structure measurements, discussed by section below based on the planar feature type, and where appropriate, subdivided by host units. The majority are metamorphic foliations and fold-axial planes. Limited measurements of linear features, such as fold axes, stretched minerals, and intersections lineations, are recorded where observed. Measurements of bedding, fault surfaces, joint surfaces, and vein walls are also limited. Complete field descriptions and locations for station numbers cited can be found in Naibert and others (2020b). Our new geologic mapping (Twelker and others, 2021) extensively revises the known extent of metamorphic terrane boundaries, igneous rocks, and faults.

Jowitt (Department of Geoscience, University of Las Vegas, USA)","Department of Geoscience, University of Las Vegas, USA","The critical metals are crucial to our modern way of life and are used in key components that have permitted the development of numerous domestic, green and military high technology applications. However, these metals are also subject to issues surrounding the security of their supply, varying from geological and economic factors to technological evolution, the potential for substitutes, the environmental impacts related to extraction and processing, and the usage of these metals. Improving the security of supply of these metals can be approached in numerous ways, including the analysis of known mine supply chains to enable the economic extraction of critical metal by-products, the determination of the critical metal prospectivity of mining/mineral processing wastes, increased amounts of recycling, and the discovery of new and economic deposits of the critical metals. All of these approaches require more information in terms of mineral resource accounting, mineral economics, material flow analysis, mineral processing, as well as increased economic geology knowledge that would enable the making of future discoveries and increase the likelihood of critical metals being extracted as either primary or by-products. Without this information, significant parts of our knowledge base on the supply (and the security of this supply) of the critical metals will remain opaque.",NA,NA,Canada,NA,SM Jowitt - geoconvention.com,2020,"The critical metals are crucial to our modern way of life and are used in key components that have permitted the development of numerous domestic, green and military high technology …",https://geoconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/abstracts/2020/56142-global-critical-metal-resources-what-we-know-wha.pdf,11,URL:pdf,NA,"Jowitt, Simon M.",590,"Jowitt, Simon M.",NA,603,2,,added child_year_guess

Ilmenite and magnetite compositions of the alkalic rocks indicate magmatic oxidation states in the vicinity of the fayalite-quartz-magnetite (FQM) buffer; in contrast, data for the quartz-rich suite indicates conditions much more oxidized than the FQM buffer.

This paper examines how REEs shape geopolitical strategies and expose supply chain vulnerabilities, focusing on China’s April 2025 export restrictions, which disrupted U.S. industries by reducing REE sales by 37% and magnet exports by 58%. The study analyzes the economic impacts, including a 45% surge in neodymium prices and production halts in automotive and defense sectors, alongside strategic risks to U.S. national security. It evaluates global responses, such as the June 2025 U.S.-China trade agreement and diversification efforts through the Minerals Security Partnership, which face environmental, economic, and geopolitical barriers. Drawing parallels to oil politics, the paper highlights REEs’ role in resource-based power dynamics. Findings underscore the need for sustainable mining, enhanced recycling, and multilateral governance to mitigate vulnerabilities.

This area is characterized by historically low seismicity, but by April 2024 it has experienced 97 small earthquakes listed in the United States Geological Survey (USGS) catalog, presenting a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of earthquake swarms in stable continental regions. These events are located in a north–south diffuse trend, cross-cutting the Eastern Piedmont Fault System, a Late Paleozoic dextral strike-slip fault, however, the location uncertainties were too large to reveal any obvious structure. Starting from October 2022, we deployed 86 Smartsolo 5-Hz 3-component seismic nodes for four months in the direct vicinity of the Elgin swarm. By using a combination of deep learning and match filter techniques for event detection, and double-difference relocation method for precise earthquake locations, we obtain up to 100 high-resolution microearthquake locations, as compared with 4 events listed in the USGS catalog for the deployment period. In our improved catalog, we report significantly smaller magnitudes in comparison to those listed in the USGS catalog, with a local magnitude ranging from -2.17 to 2.54 and achieving a magnitude of completeness at -0.20. The relocated catalog outlined a single fault plane of nearly north–south strike and west–dipping, inconsistent with either known fault strikes or the magnetic anomalies in this region. We also determine focal mechanism solutions for selected events in this swarm sequence, which shows mainly strike-slip faulting with nodal planes aligning with the north–south striking seismic cluster. Our relocated catalog can be used to constrain the location of other swarm events outside the nodal recording period and provide a robust benchmark dataset for further analysis of the swarm sequence.",NA,NA,"Elgin and Lugoff, South Carolina, USA",deployment of 86 Smartsolo 5-Hz 3-component seismic nodes; deep learning techniques for event detection; match filter techniques for event detection; double-difference relocation method for precise earthquake locations,"OE Adeboboye, LY Chuang, M Neves, Z Peng, D Frost… - eartharxiv.org",2025,Localized west-dipping seismic structure defines the Elgin–Lugoff Swarm Sequence in South Carolina Page 1 Localized west-dipping seismic structure defines 1 the Elgin–Lugoff Swarm …,https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/7610/download/15723/,5,URL:pdf,NA,"Adeboboye, Oluwaseyifunmi E.; Chuang, Lindsay Y.; Miguel Neves (School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute Of Technology, USA; Université Côte d’Azur, IRD, CNRS, OCA, Géoazur, Sophia Antipolis, France); Peng, Z. h. i. g. a. n. g.; Frost, D. a. n.; Jaumé, Steven C.",8; 863; 922; 382; 564; 1359,"Adeboboye, Oluwaseyifunmi E.; Neves, Miguel; Peng, Zhigang; Frost, Dan; Jaumé, Steven C.; Chuang, Lindsay Y.",Seismological Society of America,563,1,,"Completed Title, added child_year_guess"

A questionnaire and interview guide were used to collect both quantitative and qualitative data during focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys. It examines net annual income in Tanzanian shillings (TAS), the monetary value of a household’s assets in TAS, and food security using the Household Food Insufficiency Access Scale (HFIAS). The study revealed that nearby households (treated group) had much stronger food security than distant (control) households by 9.528 to 8.189 across near neighbor matching (NNM) and by 9.444 to 7.619 across radius caliper matching, with these differences being statistically significant at t = 2.0 and t = 2.5, respectively.
