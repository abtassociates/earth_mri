Key questions regarding provenance, pathways of minerals to deposit sites, and relations to geologic features remain unexplained. As part of a national effort to collect data over regions prospective for critical minerals, the first public high-resolution aeroradiometric survey over the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain was conducted over Quaternary sediments in South Carolina. The new data provide an unprecedented view of potential deposits by imaging Th-bearing minerals in the heavy mineral assemblage. Sand ridges show the highest radiometric Th values with localized, linear anomalies, especially along the shoreface and in areas reworked by multiple processes and/or during multiple episodes. Estuarine areas with finer-grained sediments show lower, distributed Th anomalies. Th values averaged over geologic unit areas are similar for both environments, suggesting that heavy minerals are present but have not been locally concentrated in the lower-energy estuarine environments. Radiometric K highlights immature minerals such as mica and potassium feldspar. K is elevated within shallow sediments younger than ca. 130 ka, an attribute that persists in regional data from northern South Carolina to northern Florida. Both K and Th are elevated over the floodplains of the Santee River and other rivers with headwaters in the igneous and metamorphic Piedmont Terrane. The persistence of K anomalies for distances of more than 100 km from the Santee River floodplain suggests that heavy minerals are delivered from the Piedmont to offshore areas by major rivers, transported along the coast by the longshore current, and redeposited onshore by marine processes.",NA,NA,U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain,high-resolution aeroradiometric survey,NA,Parent

The Wet Mountains are known for thorium and REE mineralization associated with failed rift-related, Ediacaran-Ordovician alkaline intrusions and veins. Structural field data indicate that alkaline dikes and mineralized veins are controlled by a system of northwest-striking, high-angle faults and tension fractures formed in a 040Â°-directed extensional regime. Magnetic and surface expressions of Democrat Creek and McClure Mountain complexes show tectonic elongation toward âˆ¼045Â°, consistent with NE-directed extension. Magnetic data also suggest the existence of a fourth, previously unrecognized mafic-ultramafic complex of inferred Cambrian age with a similar elongated orientation. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) 208 Pb/ 232 Th analysis of low-uranium zircon from carbonatite dikes and in situ 206 Pb/ 238 U LA-ICP-MS analysis of monazite in mineralized dikes yielded 465 Â± 18 Ma and 489 Â± 33 Ma ages, respectively. These ages are consistent with the expected age based on slightly older, cross-cut syenite dikes and the hypothesized Ordovician end to failed rift-related magmatism. The Ediacaran-Ordovician age of alkaline magmatic rocks and the associated northeast-directed extension direction are similar to those of the along-strike, Ediacaran-Cambrian Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen.

Coordinated with these efforts are programs supporting geologic mapping and airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) surveys that yield detailed surface topographic models of the terrain over the same regions spanned by the geophysical surveys. The collaboration leverages resources from the USGS and DOE to acquire large regional datasets that will provide fundamental data necessary to map surface and subsurface geology and structure to benefit mineral and resource program objectives of both agencies. Such regionally uniform datasets are important for geothermal research to assist in identifying geologically favorable settings and as invaluable inputs in predictive models targeting undiscovered resources that use knowledge-driven (e.g., play fairway analysis) or data-driven approaches (e.g., machine-learning methods) to reduce risk associated with resource exploration. These data will also serve a wide range of other related activities from hazard (earthquake, volcano, landslide, environmental) and resource (water, mineral, energy) studies, to mapping and land management. Surveys were conducted in two areas that were selected because they host substantial geothermal and mineral potential in California and Nevada. The data will aid several ongoing USGS and DOE projects aimed at characterizing geothermal and mineral systems, understanding the factors controlling their occurrence, and improving future national resource assessments. The first of these surveys (referred to as GeoDAWN) was collected over northern and western Nevada and eastern California and spans areas of major resource potential associated with the Walker Lane and western Great Basin. This includes Clayton Valley, which hosts substantial lithium brine and clay resources, and the Humboldt Mafic Complex, which constitutes a potentially important resource of critical minerals (including cobalt, rare earth elements, platinum group elements, iron, chromium, nickel, and copper). The second survey area (referred to as GeoFlight) is focused over the Salton Trough in southern California that contains some of the largest and hottest known hydrothermal systems in the world, as well as a substantial lithium brine resource that could potentially meet the nationâ€™s lithium demand for electric vehicles. Data from both surveys will be made publicly available through USGS publications and online data repositories.

Magnetic data were processed by EDCON-PRJ, Inc. and include corrections for diurnal variations of the Earth's magnetic field, magnetic field of the aircraft, tie-line leveled, micro-leveled, and an International Geomagnetic Reference of the Earth for the time of the survey. Radiometric data were processed by the contractor and include corrections for aircraft and cosmic background radiation, radon background, Compton scattering effects, and variations in altitude.
