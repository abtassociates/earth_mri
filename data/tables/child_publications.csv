The aim of this work is to determine the degree of importance of risks that may impede sustainable mining, considering UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators and EU initiatives, taking as a case study the mining sector in Greece. A total of 49 risks for sustainable mining, under six categories, were identified by means of expert consultation and review of the literature. The identification and prioritization of potential risks can provide a pathway towards sustainable mining operations. The risks factors weighting is enhanced using a new Fermatean fuzzy score function with Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA). The proposed model is a powerful tool to handle the uncertainties and inaccuracies in the information regarding the weights of the risks. The main research findings indicate that the most important risks for sustainable mining in Greece are irresponsible mining, the lack of license to operate, and poor environmental monitoring, which are directly connected to the aim and scope of SDG12: responsible consumption and production. In addition, according to the results the category with the highest risk for sustainable mining is the one of “Risk to Environment”. A complete list of risks and risk categories, and their ranking is presented and discussed creating a priority of actions in the framework of European and international initiatives to set a road map to sustainable mining.

These deposits are extremely uncommon, particularly in the USA. Given the criticality of these materials and the need for sustainable domestic supply, the current research seeks to leverage other autogenous processes that lead to concentrated REE resources. One such process is the generation of acid mine drainage (AMD). AMD is very common in many coal mining districts and results from the exposure and oxidation of pyrite during mining. During the generation and migration of AMD, liberated sulfuric acid mobilizes several metal ions including REEs. Treatment of AMD is required under U.S.C §1251, the Clean Water Act, and often consists of neutralization, oxidation, and metal hydroxide precipitation. To investigate the deportment of REEs during this process, a field sampling campaign was undertaken, whereby the concentration of REEs in AMD and AMD precipitates was measured directly. In the nine sites evaluated in this study, the REE concentrations of the precipitates varied from 29 to 1286 ppm with an average of 517 ppm among the sampled sites. The individual elements were enriched compared with the associated bulk Northern Appalachian (NAPP) coal material by factors ranging from 3 to 15. Furthermore, the distribution of REEs in all precipitate samples favored the heavy REEs (HREEs) when compared with traditional REE ores. This research represents the first part of multi-part research endeavor to characterize, classify, and determine the practicality of refining REEs from AMD and its by-products.",NA,"U.S. Department of Energy under Award Number DE-FE0026927","Northern Appalachian Coal Basin","field sampling campaign; measurement of REE concentrations in AMD and AMD precipitates","CR Vass, A Noble, PF Ziemkiewicz - Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration, 2019 - Springer","The conventional rare earth element (REE) industry has historically sought to develop ore deposits where geologic processes have produced mineralized zones with commercially …","https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1577094","3","URL:html","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42461-019-0097-z","Vass, C.

A prime sector subject to electrification is the transportation sector. Consequently, access to the critical minerals for electrification has become an important strategic issue in the electric vehicle industry. Our analysis indicates that the markets for scarce and critical minerals, like cobalt, graphite, lithium, and rare earth elements, are in a highly concentrated number of countries. China, a strategic partner of Russia, has a dominant power position in both graphite and rare earth elements and is a dominant player in the processing of copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements. Furthermore, at least 70% of cobalt, graphite, and rare earth element resources are in corrupt or very corrupt states. Transportation sector electrification might therefore increase Europe’s and the USA’s resource dependency on totalitarian, corrupt, and unstable countries. The surging resource dependency on China, Russia’s most important strategic partner, intensifies the geopolitical risk to the green transition. We suggest strategies like vertical control of supply chains, specific technology and infrastructure investments, innovation of other green energy sources, and exploration of critical minerals in other countries. Substitution and closed-loop technology also reduce resource dependency and geopolitical risk. However, closed-loop recycling cannot compensate for the short-run growth in the electric vehicle markets. Thus, the circular economy will reduce but not eliminate geopolitical risk. Countries, supply chains, and companies should examine the geopolitical risk and strategic uncertainty associated with different green energy sources and technology.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"A Nygaard - Circular Economy and Sustainability, 2023 - Springer","Following the invasion of Ukraine, there is a call to replace Russian gas and oil with green electric energy.

The potential interaction between Mesoproterozoic continental rifting and collisional orogenesis in the buried eastern midcontinent, and the presence or absence of a Grenvillian foreland basin, are long debated. The Grenvillian orogeny and formation of the Midcontinent Rift system (MRS) are the primary tectonic events that modified Mesoproterozoic basement of eastern Laurentia prior to Neoproterozoic breakup of Rodinia. Trends of the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone (GFTZ), the cratonward limit of Grenvillian crustal reworking, and the East Continent Rift, an extension of the MRS, appear to converge in the subsurface of central Kentucky and southwestern Ohio. The Middle Run Formation (MRF) is a terrestrial clastic sequence that accumulated in the region of convergence and was interpreted as either a foreland basin or rift-fill deposit.

Here, we use interferometry of L-band satellite radar images to reveal 617 spatially large (4 × 10 4 – 13 × 10 6 m 2 ) and presently active (2007 – 2019) slow-moving landslides near the populous US West Coast (only 4.6% of these slides were previously known) and provide evidence for their fundamental controls by bedrock lithology and vertical land motion. We found that slow-moving landslides are generally larger and more spatially frequent in homogeneous bedrock with low rock strength, and they are preferentially located on hillslopes with geologically recent uplift. Notably, landslide size and spatial density in the relatively weak metamorphic rocks and mélange (due to pervasive tectonically sheared discontinuities, foliation, and abundant clay minerals) were two times larger than those in sedimentary and igneous rocks, and the hillslopes with landslides were found to be uplifting approximately three times faster than the average for the whole region. These results suggest that slow-moving landslides can be effectively uncovered by satellite radar imagery and their occurrence and character may be anticipated from vertical land uplift and bedrock lithology.

This review examines the concept of volume and mass-specific MS, magnetism, frequency dependence, and thermal behavior of MS, as they pertain to soil material. A comparison is presented of the two types of instrumentation for measuring soil MS, based on magnetic field and electromagnetic induction (EMI). These are discussed with respect to applications including magnetic granulometry, detection of pollutants, identification of organic matter, the delineation of drainage class, paleo-environmental studies, archaeology, as well as soil erosion and degradation. Instruments that use magnetic fields can precisely measure the MS of small amounts of soil, thinly deposited layers or soil exposures, but cannot effectively measure materials at distances ≥10 cm from the sensor. EMI instruments, instead, are capable of quickly measuring apparent MS of a finite volume of the soil, and are utilized in mapping of soil MS in agricultural and archaeological investigations; however, the measured apparent MS values need to be further processed to give the real volume MS values of soil layers/segments. Although both kinds of instruments are widely used in soil science, their measured data are not interchangeable. Future work should be conducted to increase the understanding of the comparability of these instruments to find better utility among soil scientists.","soil magnetic susceptibility; magnetic instruments; electromagnetic instruments; electromagnetic induction; frequency dependence",NA,"Guelph, ON, Canada","magnetic field measurement; electromagnetic induction measurement","F Shirzaditabar, RJ Heck - Canadian Journal of Soil Science, 2021 - cdnsciencepub.com","The characterization of magnetic susceptibility (MS) has become an accepted technique in soil science.

Because actual evapotranspiration (ETa) constitutes the largest loss in the terrestrial water budget, it has been suggested that fire-induced ETa reduction is a primary driver of elevated post-fire discharge. Ten gaged watersheds with burns exceeding 5% of their total contributing drainage area were selected from California, Oregon, Montana, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. Continuous daily stream gage data were compiled, and 30-meter ETa estimates were calculated with the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model. Fire-induced ETa shifts were quantified with statistical tests that compared pre and post-fire monthly ETa in burned and unburned pixels; the dampening effect of scale was also evaluated by repeating tests on all pixels from the entire basin. Key findings include a) significant fire-induced ETa reductions were only distinguishable in basin-scale monthly datasets when at least 73% of the basin burned, b) the effect of wildfire disturbance on streamflow magnitude was seasonably variable, c) streamflow was modified in basins with as little as 6% burned drainage area; however, shifts only persisted beyond the fifth post-fire year where more than three-quarters of the basin was fire-impacted, and d) surplus water from ETa reduction was sufficient to account for boosted fire-induced streamflow.",NA,NA,"California, Oregon, Montana, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado","pixel-scale analysis; statistical tests; Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model","NM Collar, S Saxe, AJ Rust, TS Hogue - Journal of Hydrology, 2021 - Elsevier","Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for a substantial portion of regional water budgets in much of the southeast and fire-prone western United States (US).

To better manage water resources and future water supply, the influence of irrigation practices and management on these hydrologic fluxes should be quantified in time and space at varying scales, under potential irrigation management practices. To fulfill this objective, a surface-subsurface modeling approach was applied to simulate watershed-scale hydrologic processes in the Cache la Poudre River Basin, Colorado, USA (4824 km 2 ), in which both surface water irrigation and groundwater irrigation are prevalent. The model chosen for this study is the watershed model SWAT+, using the spatially distributed, physically based groundwater module gwflow , in which unconfined groundwater storage, flows, and interaction with land surface features are simulated using a collection of grid cells that represent control volumes of the aquifer. Major groundwater inflows and outflows include pumping, recharge, groundwater-channel exchange, groundwater-lake exchange, and tile drainage outflow. To investigate the impact of irrigation practices, detailed surface and groundwater irrigation routines and canal-aquifer interactions were added to the SWAT+ source code, requiring information of irrigation sources and irrigation canal locations throughout the river basin. Model calibration and testing was performed using monthly stream discharge and groundwater head. The calibrated model is used to quantify the impact of surface water and groundwater irrigation scenarios on water availability and hydrologic fluxes within the river basin. A total of 22 scenarios were conducted and grouped into five main groups: irrigation source, irrigation amount, irrigation type, canal bed thickness, and partial or full sealing of earthen irrigation canals. Using groundwater as the only irrigation source decreases groundwater discharge to streams (by 14 %) due to lowering groundwater levels; converting flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation throughout the basin decreases surface runoff by 22 %; and sealing earthen canals leads to a lowering of groundwater levels, which decreases groundwater discharge to streams by 9 %, leading to an overall decrease in streamflow in the Cache la Poudre River and changes to temporal patterns in streamflow. Overall, irrigation amount and type and canal sealing have a small impact on total groundwater storage, compared to changes in the percent of fields irrigated by groundwater pumping. Results are helpful for informed decision-making in agriculture water management and can lead to sustainable, efficient, and equitable use of water resources, helping to address the challenges posed by water scarcity and environmental conservation.",NA,NA,"Cache la Poudre River Basin, Colorado, USA","SWAT+ modeling; groundwater modeling; surface-subsurface modeling; model calibration and testing","RT Bailey, S Abbas, J Arnold, M White, J Gao… - … Modelling & Software, 2023 - Elsevier","We present an integrated hydrologic modeling approach for the conterminous United States using the SWAT+ models of the National Agroecosystem Model (NAM).

We conducted a survey of moss cover and erosion-related functions after 10 wildfires in Pinus ponderosa and mixed-conifer forests of the southwestern USA. We sampled 65 plots in high-severity patches, stratifying by elevation and insolation over each fire. Using three landscape-scale predictor variables and one temporal predictor, we explained 37% of the variance in fire moss cover using a random forest model. The predictors in order of importance were: equinox insolation (sunlight/day), pre-fire vegetation type, pre-fire soil organic carbon and time since fire. Within each plot we examined differences between bare and moss-covered soil surface microsites and found moss-covered microsites had a mean increase of 55% water infiltration, 106% shear strength, 162% compressive strength and 195% aggregate stability. We tested a suite of nutrients, finding 35% less manganese in the moss-covered soil.

Monocrystalline material is, however, a prerequisite to fully exploit these properties in devices, where one-dimensional nano-objects could be considered as a model system. As a consequence of their large surface-to-volume ratio, nano-objects such as nanoribbons are interesting for photodetection applications. Here, we report the vapor−liquid−solid growth of GaSe nanoribbons by MOCVD on 300 mm silicon substrates. A growth model is proposed on the basis of a comprehensive study of the impact of the growth parameters on the nanoribbon morphology. The nanoribbon microstructure is investigated by HR-STEM and Raman spectroscopy characterizations. HR-STEM and TEM cross-sectional observations coupled with EDX analyses reveal a monocrystalline nanoribbon core covered with a native gallium-oxide shell. Test devices are made by contacting individual nanoribbon. The current versus voltage (I−V) characteristic obtained over a range of temperature (−50 to 100 °C) in the dark and under white light illumination is fitted on the basis of a back-to-back Schottky diode model. A stable and repeatable dynamic photoresponse is measured from the GaSe nanoribbons, with an ION/IOFF ratio of 17 at room temperature.","2D materials; gallium selenide; GaSe; MOCVD; photodetectors; 300 mm; VLS growth",NA,NA,"vapor−liquid−solid growth; MOCVD; HR-STEM; Raman spectroscopy; EDX analyses; current versus voltage (I−V) characterization","P Hauchecorne, F Gity, M Martin, H Okuno… - ACS Applied Nano …, 2021 - ACS Publications","Layered semiconductor gallium selenide (GaSe) is considered a potential candidate for optoelectronic applications because of its direct band gap.

Many earthquake simulations therefore require VS30. This presents a challenge at regional scale, given the infeasibility of subsurface testing over vast areas. While various models for predicting VS30 have thus been proposed, the most popular U.S. national, or “background,” model is a regression equation based on just one variable. Given the growth of community datasets, satellite remote sensing, and algorithmic learning, more advanced and accurate solutions may be possible. Towards that end, we develop national VS30 models and maps using field data from over 7,000 sites and machine learning (ML), wherein up to 17 geospatial parameters are used to predict subsurface conditions (i.e., VS30). Of the two models developed, that using geologic data performs marginally better, yet such data is not always available. Both models significantly outperform existing solutions in unbiased testing and are used to create new VS30 maps at ~220 m resolution. These maps are updated in the vicinity of field measurements using regression kriging and cover the 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Ultimately, and like any model, performance cannot be known where data is sparse. In this regard, alternative maps that use other models are proposed for steep slopes. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of ML for inferring below-ground conditions from geospatial data, a technique that could be applied to other data and objectives.",NA,NA,"50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico","machine learning; regression kriging; support vector machines; Gaussian process regression; decision trees; decision tree ensembles","M Geyin, BW Maurer - Seismological Society of America, 2023 - pubs.geoscienceworld.org","The shear‐wave velocity time averaged over the upper 30 m (VS 30) is widely used as a proxy for site effects, forms the basis of seismic site class, and underpins site‐amplification …","https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10438255","5","URL:fetch_error | ALT:pdf","10.1785/0220220181","Geyin, M.; Maurer, B.

While the chemical similarities between sodium and lithium as alkali elements make the benchmarking strategy practical in developing new high-performance anodes, simply borrowing the anode material from one system for the other doesn’t always guarantee success unless it is based on a sound understanding of both Li- and Na-reaction mechanisms. In this work, we report the Na storage performance of a Pb-based anode and its fundamental reaction dynamics. In contrast to its excellent electrochemical performances in Li cells (reversible ~600 mAh/g), the newly developed Pb@PbO-C nanocomposite anode has limited electrochemical Na reaction properties showing moderate capacity and rate performances (~300 mAh/g at 20 mA/g). Synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy studies reveal the fundamental differences in the Na and Li reaction mechanism of the Pb-based anode. Unlike the Li reaction, the unique Na reaction mechanism involves the formation of a highly ionic NaPb Zintl phase, which comprises tetrahedral Pb4 clusters, as an intermediate phase. The strong covalent character of the Pb4 Zintl clusters adversely affects the electronic conductivity and thus limits the electrochemical performance of the Pb-based anode in Na cells. These findings provide new insights applicable to developing high-performance alloying anode materials.",NA,NA,"Lemont, IL, USA; Ulsan, Republic of Korea; Daegu, Republic of Korea; Upton, NY, USA; Seoul, Republic of Korea","high-energy ball-milling (HEBM); electrochemical characterization; Powder XRD; Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); Transmission electron microscopy (TEM); Operando synchrotron-XRD (SXRD) analysis; X-ray fluorescence imaging; X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS); Density functional theory calculations","J Park, J Han, J Gim, J Garcia, H Iddir… - Chemistry of …, 2023 - ACS Publications","Anode materials based on conversion and alloying reactions are promising to achieve high energy density of advanced sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

Boyd",NA,"A 3D geologic framework is presented here as part of the U.S. Geological Survey National Crustal Model for the western United States, which will be used to improve seismic hazard assessment. The framework is based on 1:250,000 to 1:1,000,000-scale state geologic maps and depths of multiple subsurface unit boundaries. The geology at or near the Earth’s surface is based on published maps with modifications to remove discontinuities across state borders. Extrapolation of rock type and age in the subsurface is achieved by iterative stripping of units of a given age, nearest neighbor interpolation of the remaining units, and constraints on basement geology. The subsurface depth of the interfaces between units is determined by a range of models with varying quantity and quality of constraints. Bedrock depth is derived primarily from a proxy model with added geophysical constraint in some areas. The depths to the base of Cenozoic and Phanerozoic sedimentary and extrusive volcanic rocks are constrained by geophysical methods in many areas. Elsewhere, a simple method is used to estimate their subsurface depth based on the distance to the edge of the geologic units. The remaining continental units are evenly distributed above, below, and between depending on age. The oceanic crust is treated as a simple four-layer model with the added complexity of subduction beneath the North American plate along the Cascadia subduction zone. Refinements to this technique may be accomplished in future versions of the model with more specific information including the location of faults to produce discontinuities in geologic structure and additional information obtained from boreholes and geophysical studies. Further improvements to the geologic framework may be made by incorporating information from more local studies, for example, hydrogeologic studies.",NA,NA,"Western United States","iterative stripping of units; nearest neighbor interpolation; geophysical methods; proxy model","OS Boyd - 2019 - pubs.usgs.gov","A 3D geologic framework is presented here as part of the US Geological Survey National Crustal Model for the western United States, which will be used to improve seismic hazard …","https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2019/1081/ofr20191081.pdf","13","URL:html","https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20191081","Boyd, O.

In this study, three weathering mechanisms were discussed: erosive transport limited type, runoff limited type, and kinetic limited type (Shaughnessy and Brantley, 2023). Most of the samples had SI values for carbonate (calcite, dolomite, and aragonite) above 0, indicating that the river water was saturated (Fig. 5a and b). Covered by erodible loess and affected by significant seasonal climate variations, chemical weathering in the Chinese Loess Plateau (abbreviated as CLP) has important effects on the hydrochemistry of the Yellow River and the global carbon cycle. However, chemical weathering processes in the CLP are still unclear. Based on 296 river water samples in the CLP in the different seasons, hydrochemistry, weathering processes, and their controlling factors were revealed. River waters in the CLP exhibited slightly alkalinity (pH = 8.4 ± 0.5) with much high total dissolved solids (TDS) values (691 ± 813 mg/L). The water types of river water in the CLP were primarily SO4^2− − Cl^− − Na^+, HCO3^− − Ca^2+ − Mg^2+, and SO4^2− − Cl^− − Ca^2+ − Mg^2+. According to the forward model, evaporite dissolution has the largest contribution (55.1% ± 0.2%) to riverine solutes in the CLP, then followed by carbonate weathering (35.6% ± 0.2%) and silicate weathering (6.5% ± 0.1%). For spatio-temporal variations, the contribution of evaporite dissolution in the CLP decreased from northwest to southeast with higher proportion in the dry season, carbonate weathering increased from northwest to southeast with a higher proportion in the wet season, and silicate weathering showed minor spatio-temporal variations. Ca^2+ and Mg^2+ were affected by carbonate precipitation and/or incongruent calcite dissolution, and about 50% of samples exhibited cation exchange reactions. The physical erosion rate in the CLP, which was 372 ± 293 t·km−2·yr−1, varied greatly and was greater than those of other worldwide rivers. Chemical weathering rates in the CLP showed an increasing trend southward. During the wet season, high runoff led to the release of evaporite and carbonate from loess, while the interfacial reaction kinetic limited the increase of the silicate weathering rates. The CO2 consumption budget by carbonate weathering (6.1 × 10^10 mol/yr) and silicate weathering (1.6 × 10^10 mol/yr) in the CLP accounted for 0.29% and 0.08% of the global carbon cycle, respectively. Meanwhile, the weathering proportion by sulfuric acids was relatively high with a CO2 release flux of 6.5 × 10^9 mol/yr. By compiling the data, we propose that the interfacial reaction kinetic and runoff control CO2 consumption rate by silicate and carbonate weathering, respectively. These results contribute to the understanding of modern weathering processes of loess in the CLP, thus helping to deduce the environmental and climatic evolution of the basin.",NA,NA,"Chinese Loess Plateau","measured physicochemical parameters; major elements analysis; stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen","AR Shaughnessy, SL Brantley - Chemical Geology, 2023 - Elsevier","Mineral weathering, a major control on long term atmospheric CO 2, can be limited by processes such as reaction kinetics, supply of fresh mineral, or water throughput in the …","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0009254123001742","20","URL:html",NA,"Shaughnessy; Brantley","1"

We conduct an in-depth examination of the dynamic structural evolution of the global trade network by employing the TERGM and STERGM models, and utilizing oil trade data spanning the years 1997–2021. To understand the stability of oil network trade dependence, we incorporate the cascading failure and the ERGM models to simulate the impact of external supply crises on the structural dependency relations of the oil trade network. Our findings can be summarized as follows: first, reciprocal trade structures play a crucial role in building trade relationships, with countries emphasizing mutually beneficial partnerships. Second, with the increasing complexity of the global trade landscape, the stability and resilience of the oil trade network structure have experienced notable declines. Third, in response to external shocks, countries tend to diversify their oil trade relations to ensure energy supply security. The results suggest that the government should pay more attention to the oil trade dependency relationships.",NA,NA,NA,"TERGM; STERG; cascading failure; ERGM","Q Xia, D Du, Z Yu, X Li, Q Zhang - Resources Policy, 2024 - Elsevier","Evaluating the trade interdependence among countries is the key to understanding critical metal minerals security.

Allison; D. Martinez",NA,"Women are under-represented in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) fields, and face tremendous challenges that are disproportionately elevated during global stressors. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic created unique and disproportionate challenges for women, who submitted fewer publications than men, reported decreases in hours worked due to increased caregiving responsibilities, and even left academia. However, despite these challenges, women hydrologists have not only persevered and contributed to exceptional science, but also provided critical mentorship for the next generation. We organized a Special Issue in the Journal of Hydrology to celebrate the exceptional work of women hydrologists, showcasing their contributions as interdisciplinary scientists who enrich and expand the field, and as mentors who nurture and amplify the voices of the next generation. This editorial provides the history and background to the Special Issue, offers an overview of the papers submitted, and presents the results of a survey of the authors that provides a snapshot of their experiences of being a woman working in hydrology and the impact the pandemic had on that experience. We find that women in hydrology bring an inherently interdisciplinary approach – an invaluable asset as the field tackles increasingly complex, global challenges. A key theme of this issue is mentorship. The stories of outstanding mentors within the field underscore practices that promote inclusion, support, and excellence. Their approaches to mentoring reflect a deep commitment to fostering the next generation of hydrologists and promoting diversity in science. While the pandemic highlighted some of the existing challenges, particularly in work-life balance, inclusion, and recognition in the field, amplified among women who are homosexual, transgender, non-white or from other minoritized groups, this Special Issue is a testament to the tenacity, capacity, and collaboration among women in hydrology.

Here, ten metamorphic coals from anthracite to CDNG were obtained from Lutang and Xinhua in the Hunan Province and Panshi in the Jilin Province. Bulk characterization (proximate and ultimate analyses, X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD), and powder Raman spectroscopy), along with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy were utilized to examine the transitions from anthracite to semi-graphite to CDNG. The XRD and Raman spectroscopy data indicate that from anthracite to highly ordered graphite the average crystal diameter (L a) and height (L c) increased from 6.1 and 4.6 nm to 34.8 and 27.5 nm, respectively. The crystalline parameters of the CDNG samples from Panshi and Lutang varied slightly when closer to the intrusive body. Optical microscopy and SEM indicated that in the anthracite samples there were thermoplastic vitrinite, devolatilized vitrinite, and some 'normal' macerals. In the meta-anthracite, pyrolytic carbon, mosaic structure, and crystalline tar were present. In the CDNG there were flake graphite, crystalline aggregates, and matrix graphite. The crystalline aggregates show the highest structural ordering degree as determined from Raman spectral parameters (full-width at half maxima (G-FWHM) −20 cm −1, D1/(D1 + D2 + G) area ratio (R2) value < 0.5). The flake graphite is less ordered with G-FWHM ∼28 cm −1 and 0.5 < R2 < 1, but a larger grain size (up to 50 µm). The mosaic structures were likely the precursors of the matrix graphite through in situ solid-state transformation. The pyrolytic carbon and crystalline tars are the transient phase of gas-state and liquid-state transformations.

Alenazey",NA,"To evaluate the stability of nuclear materials in high temperature gas reactors under air ingress conditions, catalytic oxidation of IG-110 graphite by two simulated fission products, metallic Pd and Ag, was studied in oxidative atmosphere and at temperatures up to 1000 °C using an integrated furnace, mass spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy system. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies show that Pd and Ag nanoparticles were successfully introduced onto powdery IG-110 graphite through an impregnation and subsequent heat-treatment process. The combined mass spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy methods allow simultaneous analysis of two gaseous products, CO and CO2, and separate measurements of activation energy for their formation reactions. It was found that the introduction of Pd or Ag to IG-110 graphite substantially catalyzed the oxidation of graphite, characteristic of decreased onset temperatures for the oxidation of graphite. Moreover, the catalytic effects by Pd and Ag are considerably different based on measured concentration ratios of CO2 to CO as a function of oxidation temperatures. Ag makes the graphite oxidation commence at approximately 400 °C with CO2 being the dominant product. In contrast, Pd significantly increases the concentration ratio of CO2 to CO at temperatures higher than approximately 690 °C, although it decreases the onset temperature for the oxidation reaction to around 525 °C. To understand the catalytic difference, the mechanism of the graphite oxidation is discussed based on the changes of surface oxygen species on Ag and Pd.",NA,NA,NA,"mass spectroscopy; infrared spectroscopy; transmission electron microscopy; X-ray diffraction","R Batchu, Z Thompson, Z Fang, WE Windes, EJ Dufek… - Carbon, 2021 - Elsevier","Quantification of oxidation kinetics is essential to develop graphitic materials for diverse applications: from refractories found in gas-cooled nuclear reactors to catalysts needed for …","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0008622321006485","9","URL:html",NA,"Alenazey, F.","2"

The Agricultural Conservation and Planning Framework (ACPF) helps identify potential locations for agricultural conservation practices by using high-resolution soils and elevation data. This spatially explicit approach attempts to identify runoff and nutrient pathways, but output may be influenced by user-specified parameters and the properties of the digital elevation model (DEM) being used. Here we assess differences in the density and location of conservation practices sited by the ACPF toolbox across three DEM resolutions in three agricultural catchments, each in distinct physiographies (Ridge and Valley, Piedmont, Coastal Plain) of the United States mid-Atlantic region. Output frequency did not vary much for contour buffer strips or water and sediment control basins (WASCOBs) across DEM resolution, particularly compared with landscape type. The DEM resolution was crucial for the density of grassed waterways but of little consequence for contour buffer strips. Placement density of WASCOBs and contour buffer strips varied by region. Grassed waterways are sited based on either discrete values or statistical distributions of stream power index (SPI). A higher density of grassed waterways was placed in lower relief landscapes when a single standard deviation threshold was applied. Using discrete SPI values for the grassed waterway tool generated more consistent output across watersheds than output based on statistical distributions. These and other reported findings can help guide user decisions in future applications of the ACPF toolbox, particularly across different areas of study.",NA,NA,"mid-Atlantic region, United States","spatially explicit landscape planning; high-resolution soils and elevation data; ACPF toolbox; digital elevation model (DEM) analysis","ZM Respess, JM Duncan - 2021 - Wiley Online Library","There has been a recent push to conduct spatially explicit landscape planning at finer hydrologic unit scales to mitigate diffuse pollution.

This paper presents results of the flake size, grade and mineralization extension of graphite in the graphitic gneiss. Field observations, petrographic investigation and comparison with other studies indicate that graphite occurrence at the Chenjere area is of sedimentary origin which fall under syngenetic type. The petrographic study revealed that nature of metamorphism of rocks in the Chenjere area is of high grade (amphibolite facies). Both field observations and petrographic studies indicate that minerals in the rock associated with graphite include quartz, feldspar (mostly K-feldspar) and biotite. Further, the mineralized zones are concordant to the rest of the lithologies of the area and biotite gneiss is forming the hangingwall and footwall. The rocks’ foliation is generally NE striking and dipping SE with the dip amount ranging from 30 to 60 degrees. The graphite mineralization at the study area occurs as medium to coarse grained crystalline, flake type graphite with long axis of up to 1000 micrometres in size.

The monopolization trends and concentration observed especially in natural graphite exports cause countries to worry about the sustainability of their economic growth because of the deteriorating the competitive environment. Examining the export concentration of the mineral resources market in the world can provide important information for the analysis of this situation. In this study, in order to interpret the effects of world natural graphite export market concentration on economic growth, the development of the concentration ratio (CRn) and indices (HHI) of exporting countries in the world natural graphite market between 2002 and 2019 were examined. When the relationship between the export concentration in the natural graphite market and the growth in the world economies (GDP per capita) is investigated, it has been determined that the hypothesis that economic growth should increase as the export concentration of goods for world countries decreases does not remain valid for graphite exports. Considering the tendency towards monopoly in graphite exports as the world economies grow, the precautions to be taken in graphite mining in Turkey, which has the world's largest natural graphite reserves, have been discussed.","İhracat; Pazar Yoğunlaşması; Rekabet; Ekonomik Büyüme",NA,"Turkey",NA,"A Konuk, YH Gürsoy, H Ak - Eskişehir Osmangazi Üniversitesi …, 2021 - dergipark.org.tr","Dünyada özellikle, yüksek elektriksel ve termal iletkenlik, mükemmel termal stabilite ve kayganlık ile birçok endüstriyel uygulamalarda kullanılmakta olan grafit, son yıllarda …","https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1865315","20","URL:html",NA,"Konuk, A. d. n. a. n.; Gürsoy, Yaşar Hakan; Ak, H. a. k. a. n.","2"

However, the mechanisms of W enrichment and their role in controlling ore formation remain unclear. Zircon is a ubiquitous accessory mineral that can provide a record of the physicochemical conditions during mineralization. Dahutang in South China is a giant W deposit (1.89 Mt WO 3 at 0.18%) associated with the late Mesozoic granites. In this study, we report new zircon morphological, geochronological, and chemical data for the most evolved Li-mica albite granite in the Dahutang deposit, in order to determine the processes of W enrichment. We classified the zircons into three types based on their appearance and composition. Type-IA and -IB zircons (ca. 145 Ma) successively crystallized from metasedimentary-derived magmas (δ 18 O = 8.9 ± 0.3‰) at 786–732 °C. Type-II zircons formed by interaction between volatile-rich melts and Type-I zircons at 669 ± 39 °C. Type-III zircons formed by autometasomatism of earlier Type-I and -II zircons, which involved exsolved hydrosilicate fluids. Our numerical model shows that the granitic melts have undergone > 95% fractional crystallization and experienced metasomatism by hydrosilicate fluids, during which the rare-metals (W, Nb, and Ta) were extensively enriched. Furthermore, we compiled data for ten W deposits across South China to investigate the key factors controlling the formation of giant W deposits. The strong correlation (R 2 = 0.79) between WO 3 tonnage and zircon Hf content indicates that an extensive and multi-stage evolution may be the key factor controlling the formation of giant W deposits.",NA,NA,"Dahutang, South China","zircon morphological analysis; geochronological analysis; chemical data analysis; numerical modeling","Y Yang, Z Yang, X Pan, X Li, Z Hou - Mineralium Deposita, 2024 - Springer","Tungsten enrichment during the formation of giant W deposits is thought to be related to magmatic and hydrothermal processes.

Tellurium is enriched in these settings by up to 10,000 times over its crustal abundance, indicating that fluids in sea-floor hydrothermal systems may transport and precipitate Te. The major element composition of these hydrothermal fluids is controlled by fluid-rock interaction and is well documented based on experimental, modeling, and natural studies; however, controls on Te mobility are still unknown. To better understand Te enrichment in this deposit type, numerical simulations of the mafic-hosted Vienna Woods and the felsic-hosted Fenway sea-floor vents in the Manus basin were performed to predict Te mobility in modern sea-floor hydrothermal vent fluids and Te deposition during sulfide formation. These simulations demonstrate that the mobility of Te in sea-floor hydrothermal systems is primarily controlled by fluid redox and temperature. Tellurium mobility is low in reduced hydrothermal fluids, whereas mobility of this metal is high at oxidized conditions at temperatures above 250°C. Numerical simulations of the reduced vent fluids of the mafic-hosted Vienna Woods site at the back-arc spreading center in the Manus basin yielded Te concentrations as low as 0.2 ppt. In contrast, the more oxidized model fluids of the felsic-hosted Fenway site located on Pual Ridge in the eastern Manus basin contain 50 ppt Te. The models suggest that Te enrichment in these systems reflects rock-buffer control on oxygen fugacity, rather than an enriched source of Te. In fact, the mafic volcanic rocks probably contain more Te than felsic volcanic rocks. The association of elevated Te contents in the felsic-hosted Fenway system likely reflects magmatic volatile input resulting in lower pH and higher Eh of the fluids. More generally, analysis of sulfide samples collected from modern sea-floor vent sites confirms that redox buffering by the host rocks is a first-order control on Te mobility in hydrothermal fluids. The Te content of sulfides from sea-floor hydrothermal vents hosted by basalt-dominated host rocks is generally lower than those of sulfides from vents located in felsic volcanic successions. Literature review suggests that this relationship also holds true for volcanogenic massive sulfides hosted in ancient volcanic successions. Results from reactive transport simulations further suggest that Te deposition during sulfide formation is primarily temperature controlled. Modeling shows that tellurium minerals are coprecipitated with other sulfides at high temperatures (275°–350°C), whereas Te deposition is distinctly lower at intermediate (150°–275°C) and low temperatures (100°–150°C). These predictions agree with geochemical analyses of sea-floor sulfides as Te broadly correlates positively with Cu and Au enrichment in felsic-hosted systems. The findings of this study provide an important baseline for future studies on the behavior of Te in hydrothermal systems and the processes controlling enrichment of this critical mineral in polymetallic sulfide ores.",NA,NA,"Manus basin","numerical simulations; thermodynamic modeling; reactive transport simulations","NC Hurtig, AP Gysi, T Monecke… - Economic …, 2024 - pubs.geoscienceworld.org","Volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits may represent a significant future source of Te, which is a critical element important for the green energy transition.

Coordinated with these efforts are programs supporting geologic mapping and airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) surveys that yield detailed surface topographic models of the terrain over the same regions spanned by the geophysical surveys. The collaboration leverages resources from the USGS and DOE to acquire large regional datasets that will provide fundamental data necessary to map surface and subsurface geology and structure to benefit mineral and resource program objectives of both agencies. Such regionally uniform datasets are important for geothermal research to assist in identifying geologically favorable settings and as inputs in predictive models targeting undiscovered resources that use knowledge-driven (e.g., play fairway analysis) or data-driven approaches (e.g., machine-learning methods) to reduce risk associated with resource exploration. These data will also serve a wide range of other related activities from hazard (earthquake, volcano, landslide, environmental) and resource (water, mineral, energy) studies, to mapping and land management.","GeoDAWN; GeoFlight; aeromagnetics; aeroradiometrics; geophysics; geothermal resources; mineral resources; lithium; Nevada; California; Great Basin; Walker Lane; Salton Trough","U.S. Geological Survey; Department of Energy","Nevada and California","airborne magnetic data acquisition; airborne radiometric data acquisition; geologic mapping; airborne lidar surveys","JMG Glen, TE Earney - GRC Transactions, 2023 - publications.mygeoenergynow.org","ABSTRACT The US Geological Survey (USGS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) are collaborating to acquire high-resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric data to support …","https://publications.mygeoenergynow.org/grc/1034804.pdf","6","URL:pdf",NA,"Glen, Jonathan M.

This study presents a new hydrologic model to simulate surface and subsurface in a physically based spatially distributed manner by linking the popular SWAT+ and MODFLOW modelling codes. Within this new code, SWAT+ simulates processes in the landscape, soils, channels, and reservoirs, whereas MODFLOW simulation groundwater processes and interaction with land surface features (soil, channels, canals, reservoirs, tile drains). Geographic connections between SWAT+ objects and MODFLOW grid cells are established a priori using a GIS and then read into the code to be used throughout the simulation to map hydrologic fluxes (recharge, soil water transfer, groundwater-channel exchange, canal seepage, tile drainage outflow, groundwater-reservoir exchange, pumping for irrigation) on a daily time step. The use and general accuracy of the model is demonstrated for two study regions that are subject to irrigation management: the Arkansas River Basin in Colorado and the San Joaquin River Basin in California.

Stearman (University of Southern Mississippi)","University of Southern Mississippi","Sediment dynamics are foundational to stream and watershed morphology. Yet aquatic ecologists have relied on an oversimplified model of sediment dynamics characterizing sediments as agents of stream bed burial, and which fails to describe many types of aquatic habitat evolution. In this dissertation I employ both fluvial geomorphic and ecological frameworks to gain a deeper understanding of how sediment dynamics shape stream morphology and fish community evolution at multiple scales. Using a paired historic and contemporary approach, I analyzed geomorphic evolution and fish community change in the Bayou Pierre, Mississippi, from the 1980s to recent. Patterns of erosion due to headcutting have advanced considerably, leading to wide, shallow, homogenous channels with coarser substrates, opposite of stable conditions in the Gulf Coastal Plain. Fish communities homogenized, and community change was tied to geomorphic process change over time. Examining the minnows (a taxonomically and ecologically diverse group), species persisting in the highly unstable mainstem and larger tributaries were characterized by traits indicative of mobility and ecological adaptability. Communities in these reaches had spatial patterns suggesting effects processes. Further examination of the Bayou Pierre showed sedimentary process connectivity at the watershed scale, strong ties between geomorphic activity and aquatic habitat conditions, evidence of an increased pulse of erosion and ongoing relaxation corresponding to the floods of 1983, and evidence that this event led to considerable gravel bar consolidation and habitat fragmentation in the mainstem. I then examined patterns of genetic structure for Fundulus olivaceus, a headwater specialist, in seventeen watersheds throughout southern Mississippi and Louisiana in relation to fluvial geomorphic activity. Planform analysis of the watersheds demonstrated a gradient between stable and unstable, and also detected evidence of a pulse of erosion and relaxation. Analysis of genetic structure and heterozygosity suggested fragmentation of dispersal and potential bottlenecks associated with channel instability. STRUCTURE analysis revealed a complicated pattern of population structure, with five of 82 populations being assigned to a neighboring watershed, potentially either from stream capture or altered extinction rates due to fluvial geomorphic activity. This work demonstrates clear linkages between geomorphic processes, altered channel morphology, and altered local and spatial ecological processes.",NA,NA,"Bayou Pierre, Mississippi","fluvial geomorphic frameworks; ecological frameworks; paired historic and contemporary approach; genetic structure analysis; planform analysis; STRUCTURE analysis","LW Stearman - 2023 - aquila.usm.edu","Sediment dynamics are foundational to stream and watershed morphology.

Trace-element sediment chemistry of arsenic, copper, lead, manganese, and sulfur revealed variable patterns among the four cores suggesting fluctuating water inputs to the reservoir depending on known conditions in the watershed or effects of local geology, lake turnover, redox conditions, or evaporative conditions in the sediments. Manganese and sulfur concentrations in reservoir sediments compared with local groundwater and surface water chemistry indicate that reduction–oxidation mechanisms play an important role in the chemical variability identified in the sediments and that there may be direct interaction with groundwater in Farmington Lake. Results of mobility experiments showed that the majority of manganese and copper were released from sediments after reaction with acetic acid and that sulfur was primarily released after reaction with a bicarbonate solution. Scanning electron microscopy evaluation of sediments showed that the reservoir sediments are predominantly kaolinite and montmorillonite with barite, framboidal pyrite, and iron and manganese oxides within the clay matrices. In contrast to the sediment chemistry from nearby Aztec Drinking Water Reservoir #1, evidence of upstream mining and milling was not observed in the sediment chemistry of Farmington Lake. This is further confirmed through identification of diatom taxa from the sediment, where no taxa were indicative of sustained low pH or highly mineralized water entering the reservoir.

We present a workflow that uses correspondence analysis, an exploratory tool commonly applied to multivariate abundance data, to better utilize qualitative data in these historical datasets. The workflow involves extraction of qualitative information on ore mineralogy from a mineral deposit database, attaches those data to a target geological feature, and analyzes the underlying data structure with correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering. The output of correspondence analysis is inversely weighted to the relative frequency of ore minerals, and therefore rare mineral species (i.e., those with unusually low frequencies) can disproportionately contribute to the total variance of the dataset. We present a novel technique for aggregating frequencies of rare mineral species that minimizes this effect. We apply this workflow to evaluate how ore mineral assemblages in former and active mines vary in spatial relation to silicic calderas in the southwestern United States. The most common ore mineral associations observed spatially and genetically associated to calderas include those related to polymetallic, base metal-rich systems and epithermal Au–Ag systems. Three other groups of mineralized calderas were identified, including: (1) Hg–Sb mineralized calderas in the northern Great Basin and western Nevada volcanic field; (2) calderas associated with elevated abundances of Mn oxides/hydroxides, fluorite, and Be-minerals, mostly in eastern Utah and New Mexico; and (3) calderas with numerous U ± F deposits, which are located in central Colorado, the eastern Great Basin and in northern Nevada. The latter three groups are associated with economically significant critical mineral resources, including the Li resources of the McDermitt complex and Be associated with the Spor Mountain on the margin of the Thomas caldera complex. We conclude that correspondence analysis is a promising technique that can enhance data exploration of the qualitative information held within mineral deposit datasets. Consequently, it could have numerous applications for mineral potential mapping, resource assessment projects, and characterization of mineral systems.",NA,"Martin Fund; Dissertation Completion Fellowship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","southwestern United States","correspondence analysis; hierarchical clustering","JM Rosera, DS Coleman - Natural Resources Research, 2022 - Springer","Historical mine and mineral deposit datasets are routinely used to inform quantitative mineral assessment models, but they also can contain a wealth of supplementary qualitative …",NA,"20; 7","URL:html",NA,"Unknown","1; 3; 4"

This work keeps the ""jack of all trades"" basic model and tackles its MCMC weak points with several strategies. The robustness and efficiency of high-level parameters estimation is boosted using interweaving strategies. Lower-level operations are parallelized using Chromatic Sampling. Efficient Hamiltonian methods are developed for NNGP models. In a second time, the versatility of the NNGP model is used in order to tackle nonstationary modeling. An original parametrization and model architecture are proposed in order to ease model interpretation and selection while capturing complex nonstationarity patterns.

Advancements in Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and software packages offer new tools and techniques for collecting high volume, accurate geologic information. These tools can provide geologists with safe and efficient ways to collect and process greater volumes of field data. Field data for this study was collected from three open pit mines using a Trimble Geo 7X GPS unit with Geo 7 Series Rangefinder module and a Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 UAS. The GPS was used to collect survey data from bedding contacts and other geologic features along the highwalls with centimeter-level accuracy.

This engineering master thesis underscores the significance of LLE within the context of recycling and resource recovery. The dissertation commences with a comprehensive literature review, elucidating the core principles governing LLE. The discussion extends to an exploration of diverse equipment types employed for this technique, particularly extraction columns. Central to this exploration is the elucidation of the underlying fundamentals that define the operation of extraction columns, a framework applicable across all variants. Notably, the ubiquity of mass-transfer with single drops as the primary driver of phenomena across equipment types is highlighted. Presently, the field is marked by a heightened interest in scrutinizing the behavior of individual droplets, particularly within counter-current LLE columns. A comprehensive modeling approach capturing the intricate interplay of various phenomena within these columns is imperative for accurate description and modeling. In this context, ReDrop (Representative Drops) emerges as a viable modeling tool, integrating all pertinent phenomena to track drop behavior throughout the extraction column. Laboratory-scale experiments with single drops offer advantages in terms of reduced dimensions and lower liquid volumes, drastically cutting experimental time and associated costs. This thesis delves into the validation of the University of Liège's single-drop cell, a crucial precursor for subsequent experimentation. The validation process encompasses a comparison of mass transfer rates with literature and models established through the literature review. An in-depth analysis of operational challenges encountered during experimentation is presented, accompanied by an operational manual for the single-drop cell. The validation procedure, conducted with meticulous care, yields positive results, affirming the reliability of the experimental setup. With this validation in place, the groundwork is laid for the next phase of the project.",NA,NA,"Liège, Belgique","Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE); Laboratory-scale experiments; Validation of single-drop cell","CD Gomez Lozano - 2023 - matheo.uliege.be","Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE) serves as a pivotal technique in the recovery, purifica-tion, and isolation of essential components, making it indispensable for recycling critical raw …","https://matheo.uliege.be/bitstream/2268.2/18365/4/Validation%20of%20Single-Drop%20Cell%20by%20the%20study%20of%20Mass%20Transfer%20Kinet-ics%20for%20n-Butyl%20Acetate%2C%20Water%20and%20Acetone%20-%20Cristian%20David%20Gomez%20Lozano%20-%20S223190.pdf","13","URL:html",NA,"Lozano, Cristian David Gomez; Pfennig, A. n. d. r. e. a. s.; Gaydardzhiev, S. t. o. y. a. n.","6"

Some of the structural and lithologic features seem to trace rifting and gliding processes, especially along the N-S oriented Kharga valley and at the western and southwestern margin of the Sinn el Kaddab plateau. Circular and oval-shaped structures, obviously related to rotation, and block-wise movements of dislocated blocks could be observed on the different satellite images. Morphometric maps and indicators derived from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data supported the detection of neotectonic deformations and of mass movements along the borders of the Sinn el Kaddab plateau. Because of these traces of intense geodynamic and geomechanically strain in this area the question arises, whether these traces are related to larger rifting processes along the Kharga valley and the SW border of the Sinn el Kaddab plateau or are just the result of block-wise uplifting of the Sinn el Kaddab plateau with different intensities, including isostatic and tectonic subsidence at the margins. Based on the gained knowledge by evaluations of remote sensing data areas for further, focused research with adapted geophysical methods could be pointed out.","Rift zones; drifting; rotation; Central-Egypt; remote sensing; GIS",NA,"Central Egypt","open-source satellite data analysis; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data analysis; remote sensing; GIS data processing; geophysical data evaluation","B Theilen-Willige - J Earth Envi Sci: JEES-137, 2025 - cmjpublishers.com","In the scope of this study the detection of the structural-geologic pattern in Central Egypt was carried out based on different open-source satellite data (Landsat, ASTER, Sentinel 2 …","https://www.cmjpublishers.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/traces-of-drifting-and-rifting-processes-in-central-egypt-visible-on-different-satellite-images-and-on-dem-derived-morphometric-maps.pdf","4","URL:pdf","10.71010/JEES.2025-e137","Theilen-Willige, Prof Dr Habil Barbara","32"

China is facing a huge challenge of serious imbalance between water resource supply and the demand for production and life, and the protection and rational utilization of water resource in river basins is of great concern to the people. As the federal government agency responsible for water science activities, United States Geological Survey (USGS) has gained rich experience and achievements in the past century in the Colorado River Basin, which has reference sighificance for water resource management and governance in China. This paper introduced water resource management and governance process of USGS in the Colorado River Basin, and overviewed the characteristics of the change of work objectives and content adjustment at each stage. Finally, three enlightenments for the management and governance of water resources in China's basin were summarized. ① The participation of stakeholders in water resources decision-making should be strengthened. ②Integrated water resource management(IWRM)is the development trend, including the integrated management between water-related departments, within water systems, between water resource and other natural resources; ③ The three-dimensional hydrological monitoring network should be completed to establish a hydrological data sharing platform and improve interdisciplinary water resource forecasting capabilities.

Diffusive reequilibration between compositionally distinct zones in crystals can also produce compositional gradients. Here, we compare the length scales of concentration gradients for different elements in clinopyroxene that originate from the Tshirege Tuff and late Valle Toledo Member rhyolites of the Bandelier magmatic system in New Mexico to determine what petrogenetic information is recorded in the zonation. Within these rhyolites there are unzoned ferrohedenbergite crystals, as well as less common normally-zoned clinopyroxene with ferrohedenbergite rims and ferroaugite cores. Compared to the ferroaugite cores, the ferrohedenbergite rims are enriched in Dy and Yb, but depleted in Co, Ti, Sc, Ce, and Nd. The length scales for fast and slow diffusing elements for most gradients measured are indistinguishable, which argues that the gradients emerged predominantly from changing magmatic composition during crystallization, with diffusion having little to no role in establishing the concentration gradients. Fractional crystallization of the phases present in the rhyolites fails to reproduce all trace-element zonation that occur in the clinopyroxene, however, indicating a more complex origin. Based on the compositional similarity of the ferroaugite cores with pyroxene from rhyolites that erupted ≥ 165 kyr earlier, we interpret the ferroaugite cores as antecrysts scavenged from crystal-rich mush during magmatic rejuvenation.

Accelerated erosion in streams and rivers may fragment habitats for habitat-specialist species by greatly altering river mainstems, pushing many taxa into isolated tributaries. In this paper, we examine patterns of genetic structuring in the federally threatened and endemic Bayou darter Nothonotus rubrus to assess whether patterns of erosion are causing fragmentation of populations. Patterns of heterozygosity support the hypothesis of recent colonization of upper White Oak Creek. Analysis using STRUCTURE software yielded unexpected results: a population isolated above an erosional feature, a population widespread throughout the watershed, and evidence of introgression between 2 of 3 genetic clusters. Multivariate analyses support STRUCTURE in suggesting evidence for 3 genetically distinct populations. Effective population size analysis found estimates of abundance to be spatially concordant with recent field studies. Our results demonstrate unexpected population structuring in N. rubrus, potentially due to populations becoming separated by features related to in-channel erosion. The amount of local adaptation related to this differentiation is unknown; however, conservation efforts and efforts to augment existing populations should take into account genetic variation and potential local adaptation.

(U.S. Geological Survey)","U.S. Geological Survey","Rising chloride concentrations pose critical risks to freshwater stream ecosystems in temperate regions like the Delaware River Basin (DRB), USA, where winter deicer applications (i.e., road salt) are common. Increasing chloride concentrations have been documented in the region, but the extent to which chloride exceeds regulatory benchmarks remains unclear because detection of exceedances requires continuous monitoring of chloride (i.e., hourly or daily). A network of 82 non-tidal continuous specific conductance (SC) monitoring sites, spanning varied land use and geological settings, was established across the DRB to address this research need. First, a cluster analysis was conducted to group sites based on their watershed characteristics. Next, regression models for sites and clusters were developed to predict chloride using SC as a proxy. Finally, daily mean and hourly mean chloride concentration predictions were made for a three-year period (2020–2022) at the 82 study sites and analyzed to determine where and when chloride exceeded federal regulatory benchmarks. Chloride exceedance events occurred at 35% of the sites, all of which had 5% impervious cover or greater. Seasonally elevated chloride also was predicted at sites with less than 5% impervious cover. Variability in chloride patterns likely was influenced by deicer material types, winter weather patterns, geological settings, and gaps in data coverage. This study demonstrated the value of SC as a proxy for predicting chloride concentrations and showed how SC-chloride regression relationships vary across settings. More broadly, this study highlighted the value of continuous water quality monitoring to assess effects of freshwater salinization at a regional scale.","chloride concentrations; freshwater ecosystems; continuous monitoring; Delaware River Basin; water quality",NA,"Delaware River Basin, USA","cluster analysis; regression models; continuous specific conductance monitoring; data analysis","RM Fanelli, M Morency, BJ Fleming, J Moore… - Environmental …, 2025 - Springer","Rising chloride concentrations pose critical risks to freshwater stream ecosystems in temperate regions like the Delaware River Basin (DRB), USA, where winter deicer …","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10661-025-14485-6.pdf","15","URL:html",NA,"Hardesty, K.","1"

Nicholas (Humboldt State University)","Humboldt State University","High-severity wildfires can produce extensive patches of standing dead trees (snags), which later contribute to surface fuel loading and present a hazard as they decay and fall. In the Klamath Mountains of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon, recent increases in the occurrence of large stand-replacing wildfires have raised concerns about fuel and vegetation recovery trajectories, the likelihood of future fires, and resulting impacts to local communities. Nevertheless, the post-fire environment may offer opportunities to enhance ecological and community resilience. Estimates of snag failure and fuel loading can support land management planning and risk assessment following wildfire, though such work is often constrained by the logistical challenges of broad-scale fuel monitoring. To examine trends in snag failure and surface fuel accumulation following stand-replacing wildfires in the Klamath Mountains, we sampled 73 unmanaged forest plots along a 25-year time-since-fire chronosequence. Snag fragmentation (fallen crown mass) progressed more rapidly than snag fall (whole-tree failure), with smaller trees and hardwoods fragmenting and falling more rapidly. Trends in surface fuel loading were influenced by pre-fire stand conditions, snag failure dynamics, slope, elevation, and aridity. Fine woody fuels peaked approximately 16 years post-fire, coinciding with 95% completion of snag fragmentation. Coarse woody fuels increased throughout the chronosequence, driven by ongoing snag fall. Litter accumulated steadily, while duff loading sharply increased between 10- and 16-years post-fire. Live woody surface fuels, dominated by resprouting hardwoods, reached maximum surface biomass around 17 years post-fire. Fuel recovery trends observed in this study suggest the likelihood of high-severity reburn is greatest during the second decade following fire. Our findings highlight strategic opportunities for meeting fuels management, forest restoration, and public safety objectives.","Klamath Mountains; Fire ecology; Fuel recovery; Forest recovery; High severity; Stand replacing; Fire; Fuels",NA,"Klamath Mountains, northwestern California and southwestern Oregon","sampled 73 unmanaged forest plots; 25-year time-since-fire chronosequence","JR Nicholas - 2025 - digitalcommons.humboldt.edu","High-severity wildfires can produce extensive patches of standing dead trees (snags), which later contribute to surface fuel loading and present a hazard as they decay and fall.

The largest freshwater lake by surface area, Lake Superior, USA and Canada, serves as a model system for understanding cooling-mediated local refugia, as its cool water temperatures and wave action have maintained shoreline habitats suitable for southern disjunct populations of arctic–alpine plants since deglaciation. Here, we seek to explain spatial patterns and environmental drivers of arctic–alpine plant refugia along Lake Superior’s shores, and assess future risk to refugia under moderate (+3.5 °C) and warmest (+5.7 °C) climate warming scenarios. First, we examined how the interactive effects of summer surface water temperatures and wind affected onshore temperatures, resulting in areas of cooler refugia. Second, we developed an ecological niche model for the presence of disjunct arctic–alpine refugia (pooling 1253 occurrences from 58 species) along the lake’s shoreline. Third, we fit species distribution models for 20 of the most common arctic–alpine disjunct species and predicted presence to identify refugia hotspots. Finally, we used the two climate warming scenarios to predict changes in the presence of refugia and disjunct hotspots. Bedrock type, elevation above water, inland distance, July land surface temperature from MODIS/Terra satellite and near-shore depth of water were the best predictors of disjunct occurrences. Overall, we predicted 2236 km of the shoreline (51%) as disjunct refugia habitat for at least one species under current conditions, but this was reduced to 20% and 7% with moderate (894 km) and warmest (313 km) climate change projections.","climate refugia; disjunct populations; lake effect; Lake Superior; species distribution models",NA,"Lake Superior, USA and Canada","ecological niche model; species distribution models","A Hillman, SE Nielsen - Journal of Plant Ecology, 2024 - jpe.ac.cn","气候避难所可以作为气候变暖下物种扩散的残余栖息地或跳板. 本研究将世界上表面积最大的淡水湖——美国与加拿大交界的苏必利尔湖作为一个模型系统, 用于理解冷却介导的局部避难所 …",NA,"4","URL:html","10.1093/jpe/rtae050","Hillman, A. s. h. l. e. y.; Nielsen, S.

Studying ophiolites can provide insight into major plate movements, such as the transition from a passive to active margin during subduction initiation. The Appalachian-Caledonian Orogen, formed during the closure of the Iapetus and Rheic Oceans, preserves numerous ophiolites across its >6500 km length. However, variations in geochemistry and timing of formation among these ophiolites have made it challenging to correlate major tectonic events along the orogen.

Beginning in the 1950s, a water quality research program was established in the Fernow to assess the effects of different forestry management techniques on water quantity and quality. As a result, most peer-reviewed research from the Fernow has focused on water quality data directly related to forestry efforts with little mention of the effects of geology, hydrogeology, or climate on water resources in the Fernow. Further, the Fernow is representative of Appalachian headwater mountain watersheds and is a protected and secure research site in the greater Monongahela National Forest.

Stokes (Rice University)","Rice University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Massachusetts in Amherst; Yale University","Rivers transport sediment, nutrients and life throughout a continent, all-the while shaping the landscapes they flow through. My thesis investigates the processes that govern the dynamics of river basins and the ways in which these processes may influence the evolution of aquatic life. In Chapters 1-3 of my thesis I investigate river network reorganization, a phenomenon that occurs when some river basins erode faster than their neighbors, growing at their expense. The exchange of drainage area across drainage basin divides can influence the relative size of drainage basins, the route in which rivers flow across a landscape, and the dispersal corridors available to aquatic organisms. If a channel is abruptly rerouted into a neighboring basin, a process called river capture, populations of organisms may be separated and undergo genetic divergence and eventual speciation. In Chapter 1 of this thesis, I use geomorphic observations to describe an ongoing river capture occurring between the Rio Orinoco and Amazon River, two of the largest rivers in the world. However, very few river captures are observed, and are instead almost always inferred from topographic evidence, the accuracy of which is unknown. Therefore, in Chapter 2, I use erosion rates to test the accuracy of topographic evidence for divide motion along the Blue Ridge Escarpment in the Appalachian Mountains. In Chapters 3-4 I investigate the connections between geomorphic processes and biological evolution. In Chapter 3, I build a coupled model that simulates river network reorganization in addition to speciation, extinction and dispersal of organisms within the simulated landscape. I find that river network reorganization can increase diversification rates, especially when river captures are frequent and the organisms disperse slowly throughout the landscape. In Chapter 4, I use genomic data to investigate mechanisms driving speciation within, as opposed to between, drainage basins. I connect spatial and temporal patterns of the diversification of an endemic fish species to fluvial erosion into spatially varied rocks in the Tennessee River, USA. Altogether, this work illustrates the rich connections between rivers, landscapes, and the evolution of aquatic life.",NA,"Michael Mars and the mTerra Catalyst Fund; Hugh Hampton Young Fellowship (MIT); Martin Fellowship for Sustainability (MIT); NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program; NSF-funded Earthscope AGeS program","Tennessee River, USA","geomorphic observations; erosion rates; coupled model simulation; genomic data analysis","MF Stokes - 2021 - dspace.mit.edu","Rivers transport sediment, nutrients and life throughout a continent, all-the while shaping the landscapes they flow through.

In order to improve our understanding of the distribution, controls, and concentration of natural tungsten in surface waters, we conducted a synoptic sampling effort of primary streams in 20 different watersheds in the US Pacific Northwest (Washington State) resulting in 77 distinct samples. We found that tungsten concentrations spanned two orders or magnitude from 10.3 ng L-1 to 2.05 µg L-1, which are still considered low considering standards set by the Soviet Union—the only country so far to set a limit for tungsten in drinking water. While tungsten-bearing underlying rock types correlated with the presence of tungsten in the water and in collected sediments, the concentrations measured in the surface water samples had no correlation with the concentration of tungsten in the sediments, nor any correlation with pH. To predict water tungsten concentrations, we used the concentrations of other dissolved elements in the water samples from which we were able to derive a model using Be and Cu which explains 65% of the variance in the collected data. Using this Be-Cu model and applying it to other existing data, we were able to predict the concentration of tungsten at different freshwater sites across the Pacific Northwest.",NA,NA,"Washington State","Synoptic sampling; Statistical analysis; Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS); Field sampling; Data analysis using RStudio","PJ Steenstra - 2019 - rex.libraries.wsu.edu","Tungsten (W) is a transition metal with high density, high strength, and the highest melting point of any metal making it exceedingly useful in industrial, defense, and day-to-day …","https://rex.libraries.wsu.edu/esploro/fulltext/graduate/Natural-tungsten-in-Washingtons-surface-waters/99900525074401842?repId=12338007590001842&mId=13338197810001842&institution=01ALLIANCE_WSU","14","URL:html | ALT:pdf",NA,"Steenstra, Philip James","1"

A package of hornblende gneiss and calcsilicate is associated with the wacke-mudstone succession and could represent variably altered mafic volcanic rocks. The graphite mineralization occurs as an intersection of graphite-rich mudstone (14.3–16.7 m wide), which is likely analogous to black shale. The vanadium enrichment correlates closely with the graphite mineralization, and suggests that vanadium was likely entrained by organic particles as they settled to the bottom of the Kisseynew basin. Graphite deposits elsewhere in the Kisseynew domain could prove equally prospective for vanadium.

The latter, encompassing the production of lithium-ion batteries, is especially significant, as these batteries are essential to electric vehicles and numerous electronic devices. The escalating demand for lithium-ion batteries has consequently increased the demand for graphite and the interest in the provenance of this raw material. This thesis, as part of a larger initiative, focused on the traceability of graphite as an important battery raw material, aiming to enhance the transparency, reliability and sustainability of complex supply chains. The study introduces an innovative multi-parameter analytical approach to differentiate graphite concentrate samples from various global locations, including major graphite producing countries. Stable carbon isotopes serve as a primary parameter for distinguishing between carbon sources. Flake and amorphous graphite, originating from organic materials, contrast with hydrothermal graphite. Through this methodology, three distinct sample groups were identified: Ukraine, Sri Lanka and the rest of the world. The Raman spectrum, characterizing the microstructural state of graphite, provides information about the peak metamorphic temperatures during graphite formation and also allows a differentiation between different graphite types. However, the microstructure can be altered by mineral processing activities such as crushing and grinding, impacting the natural structure of the material. This technique enables the distinction of amorphous graphite from flake and hydrothermal graphite types. Trace element analysis potentially differentiates the origin of graphite on the most detailed, the deposit level. The geographic provenance of individual deposits can be traced through characteristic trace elements (including V, Mo, Cr, Co, Cu, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Ba and REE patterns). Developing methods for solution-based analysis (such as ICP-MS) was necessary due to the inherent challenges in fully dissolving graphite, given the robust carbon layers. Laser Ablation-ICP-MS offers a less time- and cost-intensive method, though it also required significant method development for sample preparation and calibration. The ablation of very fine-grained compressed materials and the lack of reference and calibration materials presented notable challenges. A significant proportion of trace elements in graphite concentrates are associated with impurities and accompanying mineralogical components. These impurities can be identified and delineated through the application of advanced statistical methods and data processing techniques. Analytical proof of origin (APO) methods are considered incorruptible, as they directly relate to the chemical composition of the raw material, offering significant potential for verification and control purposes. Unlike methods such as documents, tracers, QR codes and barcodes, which can be manipulated or falsified, APO methods provide a robust means of authentication. The developed APO methodology serves to facilitate the implementation of supply chain laws and battery regulations within the graphite industry.",NA,NA,NA,"multi-parameter analytical approach; stable carbon isotopes; Raman spectrum analysis; trace element analysis; ICP-MS; Laser Ablation-ICP-MS; advanced statistical methods; data processing techniques","VE Dietrich - 2024 - pure.unileoben.ac.at","Graphite is considered as a critical raw material due to its essential role in various industrial applications, particularly in the steel, refractories and energy storage sectors.

Characterizing the subsurface architecture and extent of concealed alteration associated with this tectono-magmatic system enhances understanding of these active processes, associated hazards, and resources. We have compiled a gravity database, consisting of new and re-processed existing data, from which we have constructed a new isostatic residual gravity anomaly map of the Salton trough. We have used this new gravity dataset together with a compilation of publicly available borehole data to develop new depth to basement inversion models for the region. These depth to basement models help to constrain basin geometries, inform alteration mapping, and reveal variations in basement rocks. Due to the concealed nature of the complex tectonic framework at the Salton trough, it is necessary to utilize geophysical methods for subsurface characterization.

Petrographic and geochemical analyses were employed to determine the nature of the mantle source region and timing of the carbonate mineralization. Ratios of 143 Nd/ 144 Nd vs. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr demonstrate that in addition to the intrusion of primitive magma into the crust, a melt was generated from a mantle source region metasomatized by a phlogopite-rich melt. Fractionation trends in Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf further suggest that the mantle source region for the intrusions most enriched in REEs was metasomatized by the intrusion of a carbonatite melt and the melting of the lower continental crust. The carbonate alteration seen in many of the lamprophyres is the result of listwanitization and ophicalcitization, processes that alter serpentinite to carbonate.

This thesis is based on an analysis of the EU Critical Raw Materials Act. With regard, it gives the background of what the regulation is about and its rationale. In a critical way, the implementation of the regulation: the vagueness of the specific implementation by the Commission and member states; the imperfect establishment of the price formation mechanism of the system; the added burden put on the company’s reporting obligations at a company level; and its establishment has been met with high resistance to the local supply chain of raw materials; the capability to recycle the main raw material is seriously overestimated; there are not enough funds demanded for its implementation; and the formation of the Strategic Partnership is not solid enough. This thesis gives recommendations on the means of overcoming the challenges. Later on, the chapter compares some selected countries— including the United States, China, and Australia—related laws of critical minerals in order to explain the present provisions of these countries in the role of their supply of critical raw materials and mechanism determination. Since the national defining features and priorities of the identified countries are changing according to these major differences, the legal strategies and definitions have variations. But on the whole, the proposed critical raw materials act with the EU has its shortcomings. On the other hand, it does represent a qualitative advance by the EU toward the goal of ensuring secure and resilient access for the EU to the critical raw materials necessary for the EU’s economy and critical raw materials, which value chain efficiency and circularity will be realized.","Critical Raw Materials Act; Strategic Partnership; Supply Chain; Recycle; EU; the United States; China; Australia",NA,NA,"EU legal method; contextual approach; literature review; policy analysis; comparative approach","Z Xie - 2024 - lup.lub.lu.se","Core elements of countries' clean energy industry success, as well as low-carbon economic development, have attracted various levels of interest from countries around the world.

L’avantage de la plupart des méthodes géophysiques est la capacité à pénétrer le sol de manière non destructive, chaque méthode ayant toutefois sa propre limite de profondeur de détection. Puisque la présente étude visait à la fois les structures proches de la surface (infrastructures souterraines) et celles enfouies profondément (exploration minière), une stratégie combinant multiples méthodes géophysiques et de modélisations numériques est adoptée pour la réalisation. En premier lieu, les méthodes de géoradar (GPR) et de tomographie de résistivité électrique (ERT) ont été utilisées conjointement pour déterminer la profondeur du socle rocheux, dans le but d’aider à l’installation d’un réseau de conduites d’égouts. Des mesures GPR à différentes fréquences et ERT avec différentes configurations ont été réalisées. Des informations ponctuelles sur le site, comme les descriptions géologiques de forages et la localisation exacte de certaines infrastructures civiles (conduites) sont également intégrées dans notre étude afin de réduire l’ambiguïté dans l’interprétation des observations géophysiques. Les deux techniques géophysiques se sont avérées complémentaires. La haute résolution apportée par le GPR a permis d’identifier les conduites souterraines qui ont servi à calibrer la vitesse de l’onde radar dans le sous-sol. Par ailleurs, la technique ERT a permis de compenser la faible profondeur d’investigation du GPR et de délimiter l’interface dépôts meubles – socle rocheux par la variation de résistivité. Si dans la première étude la profondeur d’investigation visée était inférieure à 10 m, les infrastructures minières, elles, peuvent se trouver à des centaines de mètres sous terre, donc le défi est encore plus conséquent. À la deuxième étape, les trois techniques (TDEM, ERT et GPR) ont été combinées ensemble, commencé par modélisations numériques afin d’établir la détectabilité de ces anciennes galeries. En considérant les conditions dans lesquelles peuvent se trouver ces infrastructures : vides, remplies d’eau douce ou contaminée par le drainage minier acide, ou remblayées. Une démarche d’utilisation des méthodes de simulation est utilisée pour concevoir les paramètres optimaux des mesures sur le terrain en premier, et ensuite une procédure de validation sur le terrain a été développée. Selon les résultats de simulation, la contribution potentielle de la méthode TDEM pour détecter les galléries profondes sera possible à des centaines de mètres, à condition qu’elles soient remplies par une eau conductrice (< 50 Ωm). L’ERT serait plus adaptée pour les galeries vides (résistives) ou remplies par une eau conductrice, mais nécessiterait la transmission d’une forte intensité de courant. Et finalement avec le GPR en forage, on pourrait détecter les galeries si elles se trouvent à une dizaine de mètres au maximum autour du forage. En raison du manque d'instruments de mesure, seules les validations par l’observation de la méthode ERT ont été réalisées à travers des mesures 2D et 3D sur le site des anciennes mines Quemont et Horne à Rouyn-Noranda (Québec, Canada). Les levés 3D réalisés avec un système de mesure permettant la transmission d’un fort courant compris être 2.5 et 7.6 A, ont permis de détecter des galeries se trouvant à une profondeur de 100 m. Dans la troisième partie de cette thèse, la problématique de l’exploration des ressources minérales profondes a été abordée. Un protocole de mesure TDEM a été développé à travers le design d’une petite boucle émettrice utilisable dans des galeries souterraines, en effectuant des modélisations numériques des champs primaires et secondaires respectivement transmis par la boucle et induits par les conducteurs représentant les corps minéralisés. Enfin, cette boucle a été testée avec la réalisation de mesures TDEM dans une galerie de la mine LaRonde (Mines Agnico Eagle Lte) localisée à 3 km sous terre. Ces mesures ont été faites en utilisant un récepteur en forage et effectuées dans deux forages disponibles près de la galerie. Ces mesures ont permis la validation du protocole en détectant deux lentilles de sulfures massifs localisées dans la zone.",NA,NA,"Rouyn-Noranda, Québec, Canada","GPR; ERT; TDEM; modélisations numériques; mesures 2D; mesures 3D","MC Diallo - 2023 - publications.polymtl.ca","Cette thèse porte sur l'application des techniques d'imagerie géophysique, plus particulièrement avec les méthodes électriques et électromagnétiques, pour l'identification …","https://publications.polymtl.ca/53373/1/2023_MamadouCherifDiallo.pdf","9","URL:html",NA,"Diallo, M.

Chromium (Cr) is particularly concerning, as its reduced state is relatively immobile and less harmful, whereas its oxidized state, Cr (VI), is toxic. This study investigates Cr availability and solubility in paddy soils, focusing on the role of redox potential (Eh), pH, soil organic carbon, clay content, microbial activity, and ligands in iron plaque formation and metal translocation within rice plants. In addition, other metals such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), arsenic (As), and aluminium (Al) will be investigated as their presence affects Cr availability. For this study, rice was grown on soils from agricultural paddy fields in Italy and India with varying levels of Cr contamination. A ligand in the form of citric acid was added to one group to assess its influence on metal availability. Pore water was analysed for metal content over time, root plaque was extracted to measure metal concentrations, and plant segments were digested using aqua regia and analysed to measure metal translocation. Additionally, an artificial root setup was performed to get an insight into iron plaque formation. Results showed higher Fe and Mn levels in the pore water of the contaminated Indian soil compared to the Italian soil, but lower Cr levels, despite high Cr concentrations in the total soil digestion. Ligand addition increased Cr levels in Italian soils but decreased Fe and Mn levels. The highest plaque formation was observed in the Indian treatments, with slightly higher metal contents in the ligand group compared to the Mili-Q (MQ) group. Chromium contents in the plaque were higher in the ligand treatments for all three soils. Fe, Al, and Cr predominantly accumulated in the root biomass and were not translocated to other plant segments, whereas Mn concentrations were highest in the leaves. This study provides insights into the complex processes that metals undergo in paddy soils and can help predict metal contamination in grains. However, to understand the specific effects of each factor, controlled experiments on individual factors are necessary.",NA,NA,"Italy and India","Pore water analysis for metal content; Root plaque extraction for metal concentrations; Plant segment digestion using aqua regia; Artificial root setup for iron plaque formation","JF Hettler - 2024 - phaidra.univie.ac.at","Heavy metals in agricultural soils pose significant risks to human and animal health by contaminating crops.

In this paper, we detail our methodology for constructing, modeling, and semantically enriching a knowledge graph (KG) centered on historical mining data. Leveraging a custom ontology and semantic web technologies, we transform digitized archival records into a temporally and spatially aware, semantically rich KG. The resulting KG facilitates advanced temporal and spatial analyses through SPARQL queries, and enhances semantic richness by linking to additional data on the web. We demonstrate the application of our KG in the nuanced analysis of historical mining data and the generation of grade and tonnage models for two critical minerals: nickel and zinc. Our evaluation highlights the KG’s effectiveness in spatial and temporal interpretation of mining data, underscores the strengths of our entity linking method with an open knowledge base, and details the performance analysis of query execution.

The assessment of critical mineral resources in this region is aided by new, high-resolution datasets, including 50 m ground resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric surveys acquired by the U.S. Geological Survey and geologic quadrangle maps with a resolution of 7.5 arc minutes produced by Bureau of Economic Geology researchers. This study integrates whole rock geochemistry with corresponding reflectance spectroscopy measurements used in conjunction with visible to near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of multisource satellite imagery interpolated to 10 m ground resolution. These datasets aided in the development of a predictive model used to for identifying REE occurrences in the Trans-Pecos Region. The spectrometer dataset was processed and analyzed, using noise reduction, data normalization, and lithologic classification techniques. K-means clustering extracted statistically significant spectral profiles from igneous and sedimentary samples. Two optimal clusters within igneous samples exhibited significant correlation (p-value <0.05) between both trace element and oxide geochemistry. Sedimentary samples were simplified to four optimal clusters, showing correlation with CaO and SiO₂ content. Reflectance spectroscopy signatures were applied to satellite band wavelengths, and variance analysis was used to identify the optimal bands for cluster distinction in satellite imagery. These bands were put into ratios and plotted in a correlation matrix to identify key ratio pairs. Additionally, cluster spectrums were used as endmembers for spectral mapping and target detection of satellite imagery. Results indicate the ability of clustering to differentiate modal feldspar mineralization within the igneous rock suite. Absorption variations in igneous samples were shown in the 705-865 nm range and were best captured by Sentinel’s VNIR bands. In the sedimentary suite, clustering results show distinction between depositional environment, with absorption variations best captured by ASTERs SWIR bands. Band ratio techniques discriminated igneous laccoliths from sedimentary map units on satellite imagery, with a further distinction between carbonates and modern alluvial deposits. Target detection with both Sentinel-2 and ASTER datasets highlighted specific lithologic units, and further refined specific interest areas for exploration purposes. Additional work examined geospatial datasets related to environmental and social justice (ESJ), allowing for simultaneous assessment of resource potential from scientific and sustainable perspectives. Data from the Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Center for Disease Control, and others were examined for Hudspeth County.

By using a combination of deep learning and match filter techniques for event detection, and double-difference relocation method for precise earthquake locations, we obtain up to 100 high-resolution microearthquake locations, as compared with 4 events listed in the USGS catalog for the deployment period. In our improved catalog, we report significantly smaller magnitudes in comparison to those listed in the USGS catalog, with a local magnitude ranging from -2.17 to 2.54 and achieving a magnitude of completeness at -0.20. The relocated catalog outlined a single fault plane of nearly north–south strike and west–dipping, inconsistent with either known fault strikes or the magnetic anomalies in this region. We also determine focal mechanism solutions for selected events in this swarm sequence, which shows mainly strike-slip faulting with nodal planes aligning with the north–south striking seismic cluster.

Waterman (Missouri State University)","Missouri State University; School of Earth, Environment & Sustainability","The Archean basement geology of northwest Minnesota, a region covered by glacial deposits and historically underexplored for minerals, was analyzed using gravity, magnetic, radiometric, and geochemical data. These datasets were integrated to aid in identifying subsurface structures and evaluating the area's potential for economic mineralization within the Wabigoon, Quetico, and Wawa Subprovinces of the Superior Province. Gravity and magnetic datasets, analyzed through upward continuation, derivative maps, and two-dimensional modeling, revealed distinct northeast-to-southwest-trending maxima corresponding to fault-bounded, high-density, and magnetically susceptible bodies. These features were interpreted as mafic to ultramafic intrusions and dikes, several of which align with known Proterozoic fault systems and Archean structural contacts. In particular, the Mentor Anorthosite Intrusive Complex (MAIC) and associated feeder structures were imaged in detail, suggesting a layered intrusive system with possible mineralizing pathways. Geochemical data revealed elevated concentrations of gold (Au), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and cobalt (Co), often near gravity and magnetic anomalies linked to intrusions and fault zones. Radiometric ratios (Th/K, U/Th, U/K) further supported these findings by highlighting uranium and thorium enrichment zones, suggesting areas of hydrothermal alteration or felsic intrusion. The above datasets, when integrated, indicate that northwest Minnesota hosts structurally controlled mineral systems comparable to those found elsewhere in the Superior Province. Based on these results, areas surrounding the MAIC, the southern Wawa Subprovince fault zones, and portions of the Quetico Subprovince contain geophysical and geochemical anomalies that are recommended for future exploration targeting critical minerals. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating geophysical and geochemical methods in regions with limited outcrop exposure, providing a valuable framework for future exploration and resource assessment in underexplored Archean terranes.","geophysics; radiometric; geochemical; density; magnetic susceptibility; critical minerals; Superior Province",NA,"northwest Minnesota","gravity data analysis; magnetic data analysis; radiometric data analysis; geochemical data analysis; upward continuation; derivative maps; two-dimensional modeling","ML Waterman - 2025 - bearworks.missouristate.edu","The Archean basement geology of northwest Minnesota, a region covered by glacial deposits and historically underexplored for minerals, was analyzed using gravity, magnetic …","https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5130&context=theses","4; 9","URL:html","https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/theses/4079","Waterman, Michell L.","30; 8"

One of the major components of decarbonization are “green energy” technologies, e.g. wind turbines and electric vehicles. However, they themselves create new sustainability challenges, e.g. use of green energy contributes to the reduction of consumption of fossil fuels, on one hand, but at the same time it increases demand for permanent magnets containing considerable amounts of rare earth elements (REEs). This article provides the first global analysis of environmental impact of using rare earth elements in green energy technologies. The analysis was performed applying system dynamics modelling methodology integrated with life cycle assessment and geometallurgical approach. We provide evidence that an increase by 1% of green energy production causes a depletion of REEs reserves by 0.18% and increases GHG emissions in the exploitation phase by 0.90%. Our results demonstrate that between 2010 and 2020, the use of permanent magnets has resulted cumulatively in 32 billion tonnes CO2-equivalent of GHG emissions globally. It shows that new approaches to decarbonization are still needed, in order to ensure sustainability of the process. The finding highlights a need to design and implement various measures intended to increase REEs reuse, recycling (currently below 1%), limit their dematerialization, increase substitution and develop new elimination technologies.

Through the application of complex network analysis, some scholars realized that bilateral trade between two countries does not exist in isolation. The main conclusions are as follows. The global rare earth trade follows the Pareto principle, and the trade network shows a scale-free distribution. China has emerged as the world’s largest importer and exporter of rare earth since 2017. In the dependency network, China has become the most dependent country since 2006. The result of community division shows that China has separated from the American community and formed new communities with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.

Several forms of graphene such as graphene oxide (GO), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and functionalized graphene (FG), have been tested, and all have shown improvements in compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). The two-dimensional nature of graphene allows it to have a high specific surface area, making it an attractive construction and building material. The use of graphene in concrete can help lower global CO2 emissions, making the construction industry more sustainable. The incorporation of a very small quantity of graphene can increase the strength of conventional concrete, reducing the environmental footprint.

In this study, we focus on the role of two poorly understood and little studied components of LIP plumbing systems: giant circumferential dyke swarms and mid-crustal igneous complexes. Giant circumferential dyke swarms, which have only recently been recognized, are often associated with giant radiating dyke swarms, whose foci are located at or near the centres of the circumferential swarms. The giant radiating swarms are usually interpreted to be generated during domal uplift above a mantle plume. We compare giant circumferential dyke swarms, giant radiating dyke swarms and coupled circumferential-radiating dyke systems with possible analogues on Venus, called coronae, novae and corona-nova systems, respectively. Coronae are large tectonomagmatic features that typically include a quasi-circular/elliptical annulus of graben that are thought to be underlain by dykes. Novae are large radiating graben systems that are also thought to be underlain by dykes.

The current approach is to conduct on-site investigations or simplified statistical analyses, which are generally time-consuming and bear high uncertainties, except for the most obvious cases.

The timing and rates of cooling determines the likely post‐orogenic exhumation history of the northern Appalachian Foreland Basin (NAB) in New York and Pennsylvania. AFT ages generally young from west to east, decreasing from ~185 to 120 Ma. AHe single‐grain ages range from ~188 to 116 Ma. Models show that this part of the Appalachian foreland basin experienced a non‐uniform, multi‐stage cooling history. Cooling rates vary over time, ~1–2 °C/Myr in the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, ~0.15–0.25 °C/Myr from the Early Cretaceous to Late Cenozoic, and ~1–2 °C/Myr beginning in the Miocene. Our results from the Mesozoic are broadly consistent with earlier studies, but with the integration of multiple thermochronometers and multi‐kinetic annealing algorithms in newer inverse thermal modeling programs, we constrain a Late Cenozoic increase in cooling which had been previously enigmatic in eastern U.S. low‐temperature thermochronology datasets. Multi‐stage cooling and exhumation of the NAB is driven by post‐orogenic basin inversion and catchment drainage reorganization, in response to changes in base level due to rifting, plus isostatic and dynamic topographic processes modified by flexure over the long (~200 Myr) post‐orogenic period.

We use the South Platte River watershed of Colorado, USA as a case study to illustrate spatial patterns of, and controls on, floodplain carbon stocks at the watershed scale. This case study illustrates the disproportionate importance of floodplains for soil carbon stocks relative to adjacent uplands and provides an example of how spatially explicit data can be used to prioritize floodplain restoration with regard to carbon sequestration. We use the hydrogeomorphic floodplain tool GFPLAIN to delineate the extent of 100-year floodplains in the South Platte River watershed. We distinguish elevation bands for the steppe, montane, subalpine, and alpine zones. We also differentiate bead (floodplain width/channel width ≥ 5) and string (floodplain width/channel width < 5) reaches within the montane and subalpine zones. Drawing on prior, field-based measurements of organic carbon stock in downed, dead wood and soil in these floodplain types, we estimate total floodplain organic carbon stock based on median values of stock in different floodplain types and the spatial extent of these floodplain types. This estimate includes organic carbon stocks in lake and reservoir sediments in the watershed. Soil constitutes the greatest reservoir of floodplain carbon. The total estimated area of floodplain is 2916 km 2 , which is 4.3 % of the total watershed area of the South Platte River. Our preferred estimate is 42.7 Tg C stock (likely range of 39.1–42.7 Tg). This equates to 11.1 % of a previously estimated overall carbon stock (above and belowground biomass and soil organic carbon) in the entire watershed of 384 Tg C. Floodplains are thus disproportionately important, relative to their surface area, in storing organic carbon in this semiarid watershed.

Direct recycling of this scrap material has both environmental and economic benefits, such as reducing the carbon footprint of cell manufacturing, as well as reducing production costs and raw material requirements. In this work, a solvent-based direct recycling route for anode and cathode coating materials is presented that allows direct reuse of the recovered coating materials. A high yield of recovery is achieved by mechanical stress in a suitable solvent (96% for anodes, 85% for cathodes). The resulting suspension is used for electrode production to study the influence of direct recycled material on the resulting electrode and cell performance. It can be seen that the electrodes and cells with up to 10% recyclate content have similar high performance in terms of electrical conductivities, initial discharge capacity (approx. 165 mAh g −1 for graphite/NMC622 coin cells) and C-rate stability.

High mountain lakes integrate changes in the atmosphere and catchment areas (e.g., acid rain, airborne pollutants, climate change). The present research analyses long-term datasets of meteorological and limnological variables representing two tropical high mountain lakes, El Sol and La Luna, in Central Mexico to identify the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., sentinels of global/climate change). The 54-year meteorological analysis showed marked interannual variability with no statistically significant air temperature or rainfall trends. However, from 2000 to 2018, the air temperature increased by 0.5 °C. Accordingly, the lake water temperature increased (Lake El Sol: 0.8 °C, Lake La Luna: 0.6 °C). Although the rainfall displayed no change, the water level decreased in both lakes (1.5 m), most likely associated with increased evapotranspiration. Unexpectedly, the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration in the lakes decreased. The initial acid pH rose to close neutrality in Lake La Luna and to alkaline values in Lake El Sol. The latter may be a consequence of the lowered SOx and NOx emissions from governmental regulations promulgated to control atmospheric pollution beginning in 2000 and probably resulting in less acidic deposition. An additional explanation for the lakes' deacidification is the increased deposition of alkaline ions derived from activities at the volcano slopes. Since the atmospheric supply is the primary nitrogen source to high mountain lakes, the DIN concentration decline could reflect the reduction in atmospheric HNO 3. Thus, Lakes El Sol and La Luna evidenced global change. Both lakes are inside the same crater and are subjected to similar influences; thus, they showed similar responses to global change (increasing lake water temperatures, declining water levels, higher pH value, and lower DIN concentrations). Nevertheless, their differences (e.g., catchment size, surface area, water volume, water depth, trophic status) influenced the magnitude of the impacts, with higher pH increases recorded in Lake El Sol and higher DIN concentrations in Lake La Luna.",NA,NA,"Central Mexico",NA,"BT Burpee, JE Saros, L Nanus, J Baron, J Brahney… - Water Research, 2022 - Elsevier","Increased nitrogen (N) deposition rates over the past century have affected both North American and European mountain lake ecosystems.

The volume of sediment currently stored in two major catchments was estimated using high-resolution LiDAR and geometric reconstructions of depth to bedrock.

The volume of post-glacial sediment stored in the canyons and bay totals 173.82 ± 19.5336.0 (×10 −3 km 3 ), which translates to a catchment-wide sediment production rate of 0.17 ± 0.02 mm/yr. The rock-equivalent sediment volume in Moran Bay is 4.4 ± 0.9 (×10 −3 km 3 ), only ∼2.6% of the total post-glacial volume. While the estimated sediment production rate in the canyons is similar to the uplift rate, the denudation rate derived from Moran Bay sediment is 0.004 ± 0.001 mm/yr, implying highly inefficient post-glacial sediment transport. The fluvial system has been disequilibrated by glacial erosion such that interglacial valley profiles lack the steepness needed to transport sediment, delaying sediment evacuation until the next glacial advance, or until uplift sufficiently steepens the fluvial system so that it regains efficiency. Furthermore, colluvial production rates in the deglaciated valleys are close to long-term denudation and uplift rates, suggesting that once topography has been equilibrated to glacial erosion processes, subsequent glaciers do not need to produce much bedrock erosion, but mainly sweep out accumulated sediment to maintain equilibrium.",NA,NA,"Teton Range, Wyoming, USA","high-resolution LiDAR; geometric reconstructions of depth to bedrock; seismic reflection data","Y Zhu, JM Dortch, MA Massey, WC Haneberg, D Curl - Geomorphology, 2021 - Elsevier","Swath analysis has been useful for linking topography to geomorphic and tectonic processes in a variety of landscapes.

The increment in certain geochemical ratios like La/Y, (La/Yb) N , and (LREE/HREE) N from the top toward the bottom of the horizon is designative of pH increase in depositional milieu by buffering of the percolating solutions, and of preferential scavenging of LREE by hematite.

However, the positive Ce anomalies in the RB subset implicates preferential scavenging of Ce onto hematite.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to decrease the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere and develop reliable methods for its storage. Subsurface carbon mineralization is an effective solution to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 emissions. This study is focused on investigating anhydrite–CO 2 –brine interactions as a means of carbon storage in anhydrite-rich reservoirs. To achieve this, we conducted experiments involving anhydrite-rich rock exposed to supercritical CO 2 -brine environments. Notably, we conducted a novel mineral transformation of an outcrop anhydrite-rich rock within a static reactor, replicating subsurface conditions of high temperature (333 K) and pressure (104 bar). These experiments were conducted over fifteen days, both in the absence and presence of BaCl 2. A comprehensive suite of mineralogical, elemental, and geochemical analyses was employed, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ion chromatographic (IC) analysis, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) assessments. These analyses allowed capturing the changes occurring in the rock's structure and composition due to the CO 2 -brine interactions. The outcomes revealed that anhydrite, when exposed to supercritical CO 2 -saturated brine, undergoes a significant mineral transformation. This mineral modification leads to the formation of stable minerals, including calcite, siderite, feldspar, and barite. Consequently, there was an observed increase in total carbon (TC) content of up to 177 % for the CO 2 -brine treatment and 266 % for the CO 2 -brine + BaCl 2 treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of anhydrite-based CO 2 storage mechanisms.",NA,NA,NA,"X-ray fluorescence (XRF); X-ray diffraction (XRD); scanning electron microscopy (SEM); Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy; ion chromatographic (IC) analysis; micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) assessments","J Hamisi, B Etschmann, A Tomkins, I Pitcairn… - Gondwana …, 2023 - Elsevier","Scapolite is a common S-, Cl-, and C-bearing mineral in metamorphic terranes, especially those that include meta-evaporites.

A variety of existing technologies are available for use in both mineral processing and extractive metallurgy applied to RE production in the U.S. As will be discussed, once a mineral concentrate is produced, the contained rare earth value can be large compared with transportation costs, and the sections of the value chain dealing with chemical extraction (the largest cost) and separation into individual rare earth compounds can be remotely located. Also, as will be discussed, this has been the rule rather than exception in the history of the rare earth industry in the U.S. A strategy, possibly to include repurposing of existing metallurgical processing facilities, will be presented for near-term production, using a decentralized set of facilities. Also presented will be research results from the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) and the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), within the U.S. Department of Energy, relevant to economic feasibility of rare earth production, notably from the standpoint of establishing which materials are capable of providing economic production.

However, there is an obvious need for the development of tools for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) before EW can be brought to scale. Shifts in the concentration of mobile elements measured in the solid phase of soils after application of EW feedstocks can potentially be used to track weathering and provide an estimate of the initial carbon dioxide removal of the system. To measure feedstock dissolution accurately it is necessary to control for the amount of feedstock originally present in the sample being analyzed. This can be achieved by measuring the concentration of immobile detrital elements in soil samples after feedstock addition. However, the resolvability of a signal using a soil mass balance approach depends on analytical uncertainty, the ability to accurately sample soils, the amount of feedstock relative to the amount of initial soil in a sample, and on the fraction of feedstock that has dissolved. Here, we assess the viability of soil-based mass-balance approaches across different settings. Specifically, we define a metric for tracer-specific resolvability of feedstock mass addition (φ) and calculate the feedstock application rates (a) and dissolution fractions (b) required to resolve EW. Applying calculations of a, b, and φ to a gridded soil database from the contiguous USA in combination with known compositions of basalt and peridotite feedstocks demonstrates the importance of adequately capturing field heterogeneity in soil elemental concentrations. While EW signals should be resolvable after ~1–3 years of basalt feedstock addition at common application rates for most agricultural settings with adequate sampling protocols, resolving EW in the field is likely to be challenging if uncertainties in tracer concentrations derived from field-scale heterogeneity and analytical error exceed 10%. Building from this framework, we also present a simple tool for practitioners to use to assess the viability of carrying out soil-based EW MRV in a deployment-specific context.",NA,NA,"contiguous USA","solid-phase mass balance approaches; theoretical mixing model; aggregated analytical and sampling uncertainty","TJ Suhrhoff, T Reershemius, J Wang, JS Jordan… - Frontiers in …, 2024 - frontiersin.org","Enhanced weathering (EW) of silicate rocks spread onto managed lands as agricultural amendments is a promising carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approach.

Six different DES formulations were evaluated for their leaching efficiency, and the impact of alkali roasting on recovery efficiency was assessed. Additionally, the performance of the most effective DES was compared against the commonly used mineral acids—H₂SO₄, HCl, and HNO₃. The findings identified alkali roasting with KOH at 250 °C for 30 minutes, followed by leaching with a DES composed of choline chloride (ChCl) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) in a 2:1 molar ratio, as the most efficient approach. This method achieved up to 95 % leaching efficiency for total rare earth elements (TREEs) and Fe, along with 94 % material dissolution—significantly outperforming other DES formulations and the three mineral acids. The superior performance of the ChCl:PTSA was attributed to KOH roasting, which enhanced REEs liberation by breaking down complex mineral matrices into simpler oxides.

Such a direction allows for integrating organizational levels of natural gas transportation enterprises, comprising Location, Inventory, and Routing Problem (LIRP) decisions. Specific works have investigated the LIRP of natural gas-to-product and energy networks. However, due to the absence of a systematic ICT-assisted mindset, no study has been oriented from the perspective of the dynamic inventory management and geographic data-driven features of land resources. To handle these challenges, this study introduces a vertically-coordinated heuristic optimization framework, in the form of an autonomous multi-agent system, for the LIRP of gas transmission infrastructures as major carrier systems to supply feedstock and energy demands. Various extendable behavior classes are programmed into the framework to support automated agent specializations regarding procedural tasks of planning, transient inventory coordination, routing, and spatial data management in the specific LIRP settings. Moreover, the study develops an ontology-driven knowledge system, formally conceptualizing the intended application-level knowledge according to a general domain semantic model. Leveraging the knowledge system, the agents determine the necessary steps and suitable ready-made tools to solve the problem collaboratively. Several industrial applications showcase the capabilities of the proposed framework. The results manifest that the devised ontology automates model construction and the entire solution process while supporting agent interoperation and scaling the platform applications to emergent domains. Additionally, transient demand fluctuations, dynamic inventory levels, and topological considerations heavily influence long-term planning. Compared to existing practices, the ontology-driven multi-agent framework expounds a more realistic view of the trade-off between strategic investments and dynamic operational welfare in the gas system.

In this study, in situ electron microprobe geochemical analyses of hydrothermal monazite and xenotime crystals associated with different types of gold-bearing deposits are shown to be effective geochemical discriminators. There are notable differences in mineral chemistry such as rare earth element (REE) profiles, total light REE, Dy, Er, Pr, Y, Nd/Sm, and La/Sm that distinguish monazite precipitated from metamorphic-hydrothermal fluids that form orogenic gold deposits and those precipitated from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that form both porphyry Cu-Mo-Au and reduced intrusion-related gold deposits.

The global supply situation of these strategically valuable elements remains critical as the market is largely monopolistic. Thus, to alleviate the dependence on global imports, investments are being made in the research and development of innovative and cost-effective technologies for the indigenous processing and recovery of REEs from alternate sources that are cheap and abundant. Numerous research findings have identified potential benefits and proven the technological feasibility of extracting and selectively concentrating REEs from coal byproducts such as preparation plant rejects and acid mine drainage among other sources. Given the relatively low grades, the chemical cost associated with hydrometallurgical extraction of REEs from coal-derived feedstocks is excessively high for commercial extraction. Recent studies have been successful in increasing REE recovery and leaching kinetics by oxidation pretreatment of the coal-based feed. However, the reasons behind the positive oxidation effects have yet to be systematically studied to provide an understanding of the mineralogical changes and to utilize the knowledge for process development. Therefore, the current investigation aimed to comprehensively study the effect of oxidation parameters on the leaching characteristics of REEs contained in coal-based feedstocks.

Trees have deeper rooting profiles than agronomic crops, so evaluating the impacts of soils, geology, and physiographic province on forest productivity can help guide silvicultural management decisions in southern pine plantations. Here, we describe the Forest Productivity Cooperative’s “Site Productivity Optimization for Trees” (SPOT) system which includes: texture, depth to increase in clay content, drainage class, soil modifiers (i.e., surface attributes, mineralogy, and additional limitations such as root restrictions), geologic formations, and physiographic province. We quantified the total area for each SPOT code in the native range of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), the region’s most commercially important species, and used a remotely-sensed layer to quantify SPOT code areas in managed southern pine (approximately 14 million ha). The most common SPOT code in the native range is also the most planted, a B2WekoGgPD (fine loamy, shallow depth to increase in clay, well-drained, eroded, kaolinitic, granitic, Piedmont soil), spanning 1.1 million ha total, but only 12% in managed southern pine. However, the SPOT code with the greatest percentage of managed southern pine (61%; a D4PoioAmAF, spodic, deep to increase in clay, siliceous, middle Atlantic Coastal Plain, Flatwoods soil) was the 20th most common in the native range with 474,662 ha. We used machine learning and data from decades of “Regionwide” trials to assess the variable importance of SPOT constituents, climate, planting year, and N rate on site index (base age 25 years) and found that planting year was the most important variable, showing an increase of 17 cm site index per year since 1970, followed by maximum vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation. Geology was the top-ranking SPOT variable to explain site index followed by physiographic province. The Regionwide trials represent 72 unique SPOT codes (out of over 10,000 possible in the pine plantations) and approximately one million ha (or about 7% of all soils identified as supporting managed pine). To extrapolate site index values outside of the unique soil and geologic conditions empirically represented, we created a predictive model with an R2 of 0.79 and an RMSE of 1.38 m from SPOT codes alone. With this extrapolation, the Regionwide data predicts 10.5 million ha, or 74%, of all soils under loblolly pine management in its native range.

Using novel capsule techniques to minimize elemental loss, we performed piston-cylinder experiments to determine the mineral/melt partition coefficients (D min/melt) of In, Ga, and Ge between mafic minerals (amphibole, biotite, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and olivine), Fe–Ti oxides, and coexisting mafic to felsic melts. The experiments were conducted at 0.5–1.0 GPa and 770–1000 °C, with oxygen fugacity (f O 2) ranging from ∼FMQ − 2 to FMQ + 8. The results demonstrate that In, Ga, and Ge are generally weakly incompatible to moderately compatible (D min/melt = 0.5–11) in mafic minerals and Fe–Ti oxides. Exceptions include the incompatibility of In and Ga in olivine, and Ge in Fe–Ti oxides (D min/melt < 0.1–0.5). The D min/melt values of In, Ga, and Ge for all investigated minerals exhibit no dependence on f O 2, demonstrating the invariance of valence state for these elements (likely as In 3+, Ga 3+, and Ge 4+) under experimental and, by extension, crustal magmatic f O 2 conditions. The partitioning of In, Ga, and Ge is primarily controlled by melt composition, showing an increase of D min/melt with decreasing melt NBO/T and/or temperature. The influence of mineral composition is secondary. Specifically, the D In biotite/melt correlates negatively with octahedral Fe 2+, tetrahedral Al 3+, and octahedral Ti 4+, confirming previous findings. The D Ga pyroxene/melt shows a positive correlation with Al 2 O 3 content in both clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene. The obtained partition coefficients are used to model the behavior of these elements during partial melting of crustal rocks and subsequent magmatic fractional crystallization. We find that high degree of fractional crystallization significantly enriches In, Ga, and Ge in residual melts.

While we respect the excellent quality of the effort by Lundine and Trembanis on this topic, we offer a comment on their review of the runnable mental model presented in Davias and Harris (2022), and the companion paper Harris (2022). While there are several aspects of their review that we accept as debatable, central tenets of our hypothesis were overlooked. Primarily, Lundine and Trembanis (2025) entirely misrepresents our proposal as one which utilizes a mechanism of excavation of these shallow basins by secondary impacts into preexisting unconsolidated sediment. As clearly noted in the title, abstract and text of Davias and Harris (2022) we relate an interdisciplinary hypothesis that the basins were created within that sedimentary deposit during the catastrophic deposition of that sediment and manifested as cavitation artifacts at the surface. Our paper suggests a straightforward task to falsify: constrain the deposition date, method and source of the expansive conformal blanket we describe. Rather than being “thin ephemeral landforms” these basins should be viewed as robust structures, expressing to the surface and visible in our repository of LiDAR imagery despite having entire cities built across them. The lack of a prominent impact crater within the Great Lakes region of the USA is also addressed briefly here, as Lundine and Trembanis (2025) raised an objection. Among our supporting argument for such an impact is data from suborbital modeling of the Australasian tektites, combined with a tool kit for public use in Harris (2022). The extensive runnable mental model of Davias and Harris (2025) address many of the concerns raised in Lundine and Trembanis (2025).

The common view is that the pathological autoimmunity develops in genetically predisposed individuals upon exposure to an environmental trigger. This highlights the importance of recognizing and deconstructing the effects of environmental agents in rheumatic diseases. Several factors have been identified in the last decades, with detrimental or protective effects, impacting not only on disease onset, but also on its natural history. Cigarette smoking has been identified as one of the strongest environmental risk factors, being associated with disease development and severity for several rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and spondyloarthropathies. Moreover, other airborne pollutants, such as silica, solvents, asbestos and metals are recognized risk factors for rheumatic diseases. The effect of some other agents is however not straightforward, of which a remarkable example is alcohol consumption. Alcohol has been associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, exerting a variable effect on rheumatic diseases depending on quantity and frequency of consumption, as well as sex and ethnicity. Similarly, ultraviolet light exposure has been associated with a higher risk of SLE but lower risk of RA. The relationship between microbial exposure and autoimmunity is also complex: while some infectious agents increase the risk of rheumatic diseases, it is widely accepted that less exposure to microbial agents, particularly during immune system development, increases the risk of autoimmunity. Furthermore, in recent years the spotlight has switched to the human microbiome, as alterations in organ-specific microbiome composition are anticipated to be early participants in the onset of immune-mediated illnesses. The aim of this review is to highlight the most relevant environmental factors and their role in Rheumatology, with a specific focus on proposed pathophysiological effect and correlation with clinical outcomes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JC Pfau, B McLaurin, BJ Buck, FW Miller - Autoimmunity Reviews, 2024 - Elsevier","A growing body of evidence supports an association between systemic autoimmune disease and exposure to amphibole asbestos, a form of asbestos typically with straight, stiff, needle …",NA,"20","URL:html",NA,"JC Pfau, B.

We sampled cavefishes and cave crayfishes at 61 sampling units using both visual and environmental DNA surveys. We then modeled occurrence probability in relation to lithology and human disturbance while accounting for imperfect detection. Our results indicated that occurrence probability of cave crayfishes was negatively associated with human disturbance, whereas there was a weak positive relationship between cavefish occurrence and disturbance. Both cavefishes and cave crayfishes were more likely to occur in limestone rather than dolostone lithology.

We explore clinopyroxene zoning to track the evolution of peralkaline magmas and the mechanisms that trigger critical metal mineralisation, focusing on the Mesozoic Benolong Volcanic Suite in eastern Australia, which includes a zirconium + hafnium + niobium + tantalum mineralised subvolcanic sill. Major and trace element analysis of clinopyroxene across the volcanic field tracks continuous magma differentiation from diopside-hedenbergite to aegirine, associated with progressive enrichment of rare metals. Crucially, aegirine in the mineralised trachyte becomes sector-zoned and depleted in critical metals, which instead partition into latest-stage eudialyte. Association with vesiculated portions of the sill suggests that sector zoning is the product of undercooling which may be driven by degassing. Because volatiles increase the solubility of critical metals in silicate magmas, we suggest retention of volatiles and dynamic crystallisation conditions drive enrichment of critical metals in the Toongi deposit. Our data show that pyroxene chemistry and zoning can help track fertility in critical metals in peralkaline magmas.","peralkaline magmas; critical metals; rare earth elements; clinopyroxene zoning; mineralisation",NA,"Mesozoic Benolong Volcanic Suite, eastern Australia","electron microprobe; laser-ablation mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS); major and trace element analysis","B Simpson, T Ubide, C Spandler - Communications Earth & …, 2025 - nature.com","Highly sodic peralkaline magmas can reach hyper-enrichment in critical metals including rare earth elements (REE).

We introduce the ecological source index (ECSI) to identify ecological sources in Chenzhou and construct an ecological resistance surface (ERS) by incorporating mining district locations. Using circuit theory, we map key ecological corridors and nodes, establishing the ecological security framework for Chenzhou. Our findings show 2,903 km² of primary ecological sources, 1,735 km² of secondary ES, and 2,124 km² of tertiary ES, along with 90 ecological corridors (1,183.66 km), 22 inactive corridors (983.37 km), 3 major river corridors, 68 pinch points, and 80 barriers. The ecological sources are organized in a “dominant source with multiple subsidiary cores” structure, connected by a “three horizontal and four vertical” corridor network. Ecological sources are primarily located in the east, while corridors, pinch points, and barriers are concentrated in the west. Barriers are mainly urban areas, mining zones, and farmland, while pinch points occur in narrow corridor sections, especially near towns and mining areas. Mining activities cause localized shifts and fragmentation of ecological corridors. We propose recommendations for mining management, such as implementing strict mining approval processes, constructing artificial ecological corridors, and expanding ecological channel boundaries in pinch point clusters.

In that sense, this study has three objectives: Understanding the limitations of the traditional model, analyzing the use of Real Options as an alternative to assess the value of a mining project under uncertain circumstances, and delving into the details of risk management in the mining industry. An open-pit case study is presented. Real Options are compared to the traditional methodologies to understand the situations where it is suitable to apply this tool. Two case studies are presented: one when the NPV is close to zero, and the other one, the NPV is far greater than zero. The results showed that using Real Options only adds value for projects with an NPV close to zero, while it has a detrimental effect when the NPV is very high.

Thereupon, the developing market of batteries reinforces the concern over the resilient and consistent supply of battery raw materials. By the reason of the interdependencies of all the stages involved in a value chain of a battery, it is critical to identify the battery material supply-disruptive risks and uncertainties, and subsequently to analyze the impacts of the perpetuation of the supply issues on the future market of batteries. In this research study, to contribute to these processes necessary for overcoming the ongoing supply sustainability challenges, the focus is on lithium, nickel, graphite, and cobalt, which are among the battery raw materials with high supply risks. After analyzing and categorizing the driving forces behind the historical and current bottlenecks to their mining production, the regional and global mining production of those battery materials have been predicted for twenty years ahead using three time series forecasting techniques including Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Holt's linear trend, and Holt-Winters’ methods. Forecasting possible future production trends of those battery raw materials is indisputably imperative to resolve planning strategies while dealing with uncertainties and supply risks.

However, as the production and availability of geologic map databases continues to increase, inconsistent data models and the lack of synthesized, national geologic map data at scales appropriate for informed decision making negatively affect the functional integration of geologic map data with other national datasets. The Geologic Map Schema (GeMS) is the publication and archive database standard for geologic map data funded by the U.S. Geological Survey National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, and standardizes the organization and content of a single map database. However, synthesizing multiple databases into a seamless geologic map database creates a different set of challenges and database needs than GeMS was designed to accommodate. The Seamless Integrated Geologic Mapping (SIGMa) extension is designed to expand the capabilities of GeMS by enabling integration of map-based geoscience data. In particular, the SIGMa extension enables capturing a diverse and ever-changing set of map units, produced by many contributors operating independently, and by incremental and noncontiguous assembly and publication. Feature-level metadata fields allow data sources and digital compilation methods to be attributed separately and a relational structure is designed to support the link between data sources and features attributed with multiple data sources. Instead of paragraph-style map-unit descriptions that can be highly inconsistent, SIGMa parses fundamental map-unit attributes, including material, genetic process, and age, into thematically specific fields. The SIGMa extension uses a hierarchical map-unit organization to facilitate a dynamic and evolving, formation-level stratigraphic framework. The hierarchy is developed around geologic provinces that represent temporally restricted geologic events, processes, and settings. Geologic provinces can include magmatic events, depositional settings associated with tectonic processes or stable continental margins, and processes that are actively shaping the modern landscape. A geologic province hierarchy places map units into a geologic context at subregional to continental scales and provides the flexibility to support incremental assembly of the stratigraphy.",NA,"U.S. Geological Survey National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program",NA,NA,"KJ Turner, JB Workman, J Colgan, AK Gilmer, ME Berry… - 2022 - pubs.usgs.gov","Geologic maps are the fundamental building blocks of surface and subsurface three-dimensional geologic framework models of the Earth's crust.

An integrated modeling approach is presented to quantify spatiotemporal field-level abstraction volumes. The approach is both demand-driven, using crop growth algorithms and soil moisture to trigger irrigation events, and supply-constrained, using simulated groundwater storage to constrain extraction. The approach uses the SWAT + hydrologic model, with the use of the gwflow subroutine for simulating spatially distributed groundwater storage and flow. The approach is demonstrated for the Mississippi Delta (northwest Mississippi, USA), a region of high groundwater irrigation and groundwater depletion, for the period 2000–2020. The model is corroborated using system responses that constrain both soil moisture and groundwater storage: streamflow, crop yield, crop evapotranspiration, groundwater level changes, and annual abstraction volumes. Results show good agreement for all system responses, with groundwater level changes matching groundwater depletion magnitudes in the central region of the Big Sunflower Watershed. Simulated annual abstraction volumes generally match measured volumes on an average and frequency basis, although an underestimation of 20% occurs for one year (2015), due to the automatic irrigation feature of the model. Therefore, in addition to providing accurate annual volumes of groundwater abstraction for most years, the model can also be used to quantify the volume of excessive irrigation, and hence the volume of groundwater depletion that can be prevented. This modeling approach can be used to estimate historical abstraction rates and predict future changes in groundwater abstraction and storage trends for varying climate and management scenarios.",NA,NA,"Mississippi Delta, USA","integrated modeling approach; SWAT+ hydrologic model; gwflow subroutine","RT Bailey, S Abbas, N Čerkasova, JG Arnold… - Hydrogeology …, 2025 - Springer","Estimates of groundwater abstraction volumes for irrigation are essential for water management and water supply forecasting.

Daily water-table altitude is used to estimate diffuse and rapid recharge in response to daily precipitation, snowmelt, and evapotranspiration. The model is defined from balance equations, where instead of soil-moisture retention functions defining unsaturated-zone fluxes, fluxes are defined using parameters analogous to the water-residence time in the unsaturated zone. Unsaturated-zone balance equations are coupled at the water table, combining recharge at the water table, the time-varying water-table altitude, and fluxes in the saturated flow regime. The model is applied over a 17-year period at 32 US Geological Survey Climate Response Network wells completed in the unconsolidated Coastal Plain aquifer and fractured-rock aquifers across the DRB. Daily estimates of diffuse and rapid recharge are aggregated over seasons and seasonal characteristics of the frequency and magnitude of rapid recharge are compared across different geologic settings. The fraction of the average seasonally aggregated recharge attributed to rapid recharge (Φ r-rech) at monitoring locations is largely explained by the depth to the water table (DTW) and the geologic setting, which is defined from the geologic age and lithology. Distinctive characteristics of the void space within different geologic settings are hypothesized to influence the occurrence of rapid recharge.

This will increase the demand for raw materials used in batteries, such as graphite. Further, due to geopolitical risk and the need for sustainable sources, graphite mining is also of interest in Europe and nations like Finland. During the concentration and/or refining of ore, an enormous amount of waste is produced due to the low concentration of the desired element. Some of the material of interest ends up in these side streams, as for example, in the tailings. However, the waste can potentially be used as a secondary source of raw materials. In this work the potential processing scenarios of graphite mine tailings were investigated. The studied tailings samples originated from pilot metallurgical test work done in Canada with Aitolampi graphite ore. According to the analysis results, the tailings contain high concentrations of sulfidic sulfur and heavy metals, posing a potential risk of acid mine drainage. In this work, the potential strategies for harmful elements removal were studied and advantages and disadvantages were evaluated. This thesis work included magnetic and gravity separation test work done for tailings samples. Additionally, leaching experiments with varying acid molarity, temperature, and solid-to-liquid ratio were conducted. Based on the results, with a low-intensity magnetic separator, 58–64% of sulfidic sulfur could be recovered. Additionally, the magnetic product is theoretically suitable to be used in sulfuric acid production. Further, with gravity separation, the grade of Ni, Co, Cu, and Zn could be increased by a ratio of two to three. By leaching experiments, the leaching orders of the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite were confirmed. However, the concentrations of Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn in the tailings were too low, and Fe was too high to be economically attractive, so that recovery utilizing only leaching would be economical. This suggests that low grade tailings will still require technological innovations to achieve concentrates suitable for state-of-the-art refining.","Circular economy; graphite; tailings; sulfur; metal recovery","BATCircle 2.0 project; Geological Survey of Finland; Academy of Finland","Finland","magnetic separation; gravity separation; leaching experiments","SJ Rytkönen - 2022 - repository.tudelft.nl","The electrification of the world and the green transition are expected to increase the demand for energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries.

This includes improving raw material and material efficiency, building a strategic position in the global value chain, ensuring long-term supply sustainability, stimulating local demand, prioritizing the use of green energy, enhancing effective hazardous waste management, and addressing social issues in mining and processing areas. The analysis of Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) in nickel downstream development indicates that, although substantial investment is required, a quicker return on investment can be achieved through technological changes, such as adopting pyrometallurgy. The NPV and IRR evaluation in copper downstream development demonstrates the economic feasibility of processing copper concentrate, showing significant profitability. The copper industry continues to grow with added value in the value chain, highlighting the economic benefits of copper downstream development. The prospects downstream development of bauxite and aluminum are also promising. Based on NPV results, brownfield projects appear more economically viable than greenfield projects.

The Neoproterozoic Borborema Province presents direct linkage to several orogenic belts along western Gondwana, but its crustal evolution is contentious resulting in a range of geological models. In the region, exotic terranes that might have been docked via thrust- and strike slip structures preserve pre-Gondwana events that provide glimpses for the evolution of orogenic systems more generally. A total of 201 Sm Nd analysis of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic Alto Moxotó Terrane, central Borborema Province reveals source ages in granitic, mafic and metasedimentary rocks that are mostly Paleoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic, which contrast with the adjacent terranes. The successive juvenile inputs and crustal reworking from Neoarchean ( ca. 2.6 Ga) to mid-Paleoproterozoic ( ca. 2.1 Ga) diverge with the early to late Neoproterozoic dominant crust of the neighboring blocks. 3D geophysical modelling highlights the unique signature of the Alto Moxotó Terrane compared to these blocks, including: i) K-poor and Th-rich crust and ii) higher gravity gradients when compared with the bordering lithospheric record, both in gamma-spectrometric and gravimetric maps. Moreover, prominent magnetic anomalies in all magnetometric maps coincide with the major shear zones, including previously proposed terrane boundaries, suggesting that they might represent cryptic or unmapped suture zones.

In order to figure out the role of granites in the formation of the Zhuxi deposit, textures and compositions of apatites in the Zhuxi granites were investigated. Granites related to the Zhuxi W-Cu deposit include biotite granite, muscovite granite, and granite porphyry. Apatites in these granites are named Group A, Group B (core – Group B1; rim – Group B2), and Group C, respectively. Along this sequence, geochemical characteristics of apatites show gradual enrichment of total rare earth elements (ΣREE), high-field strength elements (HFSE; Th, U, Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf), as well as ore-forming element W, and depletion of Sr. Meanwhile, Ga content in these apatites consecutively increased, indicating the reduction of oxygen fugacity in the Zhuxi magmatic system. Non-chondritic Y/Ho (mostly > 34) and Zr/Hf (broadly < 5) ratios in Group C apatite reflect the high volume of fluids interacted with the magma of the most evolved granite porphyry. Constant high F contents (3.4–4.4 wt%) in all apatite samples show abundant F in the Zhuxi magmas, which played an important role in the formation of the Zhuxi deposit in terms of facilitating W enrichment in magma and exsolution of W into hydrothermal fluids. The Zhuxi granites formed at ca. 153 Ma when South China Block was in an extensional tectonic setting, and the granite porphyry is the most potential intrusion to cause the mineralization of the Zhuxi deposit.","apatite; granites; W-Cu deposit; geochemistry; mineralization",NA,"Zhuxi, China","cathodoluminescence imaging; back-scattered electron imaging; geochemical analysis","CN Mercer, KE Watts, J Gross - Ore Geology Reviews, 2020 - Elsevier","The southeast Missouri iron metallogenic province contains a remarkable wealth of historically important Fe, Cu, Au, and rare earth element (REE) deposits including the Pea …","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0169136818308394","2","URL:html",NA,NA,"7"

However, the descriptive information that forms the basis for a preferred map interpretation is typically stored in geological map databases as unstructured text data that are difficult to use in practice. Herein we apply natural language processing (NLP) to geoscientific text data from Canada, the U.S., and Australia to address that knowledge gap. First, rock descriptions, geological ages, lithostratigraphic and lithodemic information, and other long-form text data are translated to numerical vectors, i.e., a word embedding, using a geoscience language model. Network analysis of word associations, nearest neighbors, and principal component analysis are then used to extract meaningful semantic relationships between rock types. We further demonstrate using simple Naive Bayes classifiers and the area under receiver operating characteristics plots (AUC) how word vectors can be used to: (1) predict the locations of “pegmatitic” (AUC = 0.962) and “alkalic” (AUC = 0.938) rocks; (2) predict mineral potential for Mississippi-Valley-type (AUC = 0.868) and clastic-dominated (AUC = 0.809) Zn-Pb deposits; and (3) search geoscientific text data for analogues of the giant Mount Isa clastic-dominated Zn-Pb deposit using the cosine similarities between word vectors. This form of semantic search is a promising NLP approach for assessing mineral potential with limited training data. Overall, the results highlight how geoscience language models and NLP can be used to extract new knowledge from unstructured text data and reduce the mineral exploration search space for critical raw materials.","natural language processing; geoscience; prospectivity modeling; geological maps; word embeddings",NA,"Canada, U.S., Australia","natural language processing; network analysis; principal component analysis; Naive Bayes classifiers; cosine similarities","CJM Lawley, MG Gadd, M Parsa, GW Lederer… - Natural Resources …, 2023 - Springer","Geological maps are powerful models for visualizing the complex distribution of rock types through space and time.

Therefore, Li mineralization theory must be further developed to realize the comprehensive utilization of bauxite resources. The Qinyuan Li–rich bauxite is formed in the Benxi Epoch of the Late Carboniferous and its parent rock is the underlying Ordovician limestone. In this study, the methods of stepwise extraction and element geochemical are utilized to discuss the occurrence state and sedimentary environment of Li in Qinyuan bauxite, respectively. Based on the differences in element composition, the Qinyuan Li–rich bauxite sequence can be divided into clay rocks, bauxitic clays, iron–rich clays, and bauxite from the bottom to the top. The Li content of the Qinyuan bauxite samples is highest in clay rocks (averaging 431 µg/g), followed by bauxitic clays (averaging 288 µg/g), bauxite (averaging 252 µg/g), and iron–rich clays (averaging 202 µg/g). The main mineral compositions of these samples are diaspore, calcite, anatase, pyrite, siderite, kaolinite, and illite. Among them, the Li content is positively correlated with clay mineral contents (R² = 0.71), indicating that clay minerals are the main Li–rich minerals. More specifically, the clay mineral in bauxitic clays, bauxite, and iron–rich clays are kaolinite, and the positive correlation between Li and kaolinite (R² = 0.46) indicates that kaolinite is the main Li–rich mineral. Nevertheless, the clay minerals in clay rocks are kaolinite and illite, and the correlation between Li and illite (R² = 0.54) is higher than kaolinite (R² = 0.10), indicating that Li is preferentially enriched in illite when kaolinite and illite coexist. It was found that the majority (higher than 99 %) of Li is hosted in the vacant sites of Si–O tetrahedral layers and the Al–O dioctahedral layers of illite and kaolinite to compensate the positive charge deficit caused by replacement of Si4+ and Al3+ in the tetrahedral and dioctahedral layers of clay minerals, respectively. Furthermore, the content ratios between typical elements with varied migration–deposition properties can indicate the depositional environment of Li–rich bauxite. Among them, MgO/Al2O3 and Rb/K (range from 1.3 × 10 -3 to 7.36 × 10 -2 and 3 × 10 -4 to 3.44 × 10 -2 in samples, respectively) can indicate sedimentary environment. Th/U, V/Cr, and V/(V + Ni) (range from 0.45 to 3.73, 0.85 to 3.54, and 0.27 to 0.89 in samples, respectively) can indicate the paleo–redox conditions. Sr/Cu, CIA, and C value (range from 3.53 to 48.2, 93.8 to 99.9, and 0.43 to 7.29 in samples, respectively) can indicate paleoclimate. The results show that the Qinyuan bauxite possibly formed in the hot, humid (Sr/Cu > 5, CIA = 85–100, and C value > 0.8), and dysoxic–anoxic (Th/U = 2–7, V/Cr = 2–4.25, and V/(V + Ni) = 0.46–0.84) marine–continental transitional (MgO/Al2O3 = 0.01–0.1 and Rb/K = 4 × 10 -3 –6 × 10 -3) environment.","lithium; bauxite; geochemistry; sedimentary environment",NA,"Qinyuan County, Shanxi, China","stepwise extraction; element geochemical analysis","S Zhang, X Liu, F Zhao, D Liu, Y Zou, W Zhang… - Journal of Geochemical …, 2021 - Elsevier","Karst bauxite resources are widespread in the Shanxi Province, accounting for the richest bauxite resources in China.

We present field observations, uranium-lead (U–Pb) monazite and titanite geochronology, carbon (C) and sulfur (S) stable isotope geochemistry, and graphite Raman spectroscopy data from this deposit that support a new model of flake graphite ore genesis in high-grade metamorphic environments. The Graphite Creek deposit is within the second sillimanite metamorphic zone of the Kigluaik Mountains gneiss dome. Flake graphite, hosted in sillimanite-gneiss and quartz-biotite paragneiss, occurs as disseminations and in sets of very high grade (up to 50 wt.% graphite), semi-massive to massive graphite lenses 0.2 to 1 m wide containing quartz, sillimanite, inclusions of garnet porphyroblasts, K-feldspar, and tourmaline. Restitic garnet, sillimanite, graphite, and biotite accumulations indicate a high degree of anatexis and melt loss. Strong yttrium depletion in monazite, high europium ratios (Eu/Eu*), and excursions of high strontium and thorium concentrations are consistent with biotite dehydration melting. Monazite and titanite U–Pb ages record peak metamorphism from ~ 97 to 92 million years ago (Ma) and a retrograde event at ~ 85 Ma. Raman spectroscopy confirms the presence of carbonaceous material and highly ordered, crystalline graphite. Graphite δ 13 C VPDB values of −30 to −12‰ and pyrrhotite δ 34 S VCDT values of −14 to 10‰ are consistent with derivation from organic carbon and sulfur in sedimentary rocks, respectively. These data collectively suggest that formation of massive graphite lenses occurred approximately synchronously with high-temperature metamorphism and anatexis of a highly carbonaceous pelitic protolith. Melt extraction and fluid release associated with anatexis were likely crucial for concentrating graphite. High-temperature, graphitic migmatite sequences within high-strain shear zones may be favorable for the occurrence of high-grade flake graphite deposits.","graphite; geochronology; geochemistry; metamorphism; Alaska",NA,"Seward Peninsula, Alaska, USA","field observations; U–Pb monazite geochronology; U–Pb titanite geochronology; carbon stable isotope geochemistry; sulfur stable isotope geochemistry; graphite Raman spectroscopy","GND Case, SM Karl, SP Regan, CA Johnson… - Mineralium …, 2023 - Springer","Graphite Creek is an unusual flake graphite deposit located on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, USA.

The basin experienced multiple-stage complex tectonic movements, whose influences on burial, thermal maturation and gas generation histories in different areas are poorly understood. Based on a detailed study of the denudation stages, strata thickness, and thermal history of the basin, burial and thermal maturation histories of seven wells in different areas were modelled using PetroMod software. Due to the high maturity of the WL shale, a low-maturity Silurian Polish Llandovery shale was used for gold tube closed-system pyrolysis experiments to obtain kinetic parameters for evaluating methane generation history. The Polish shale was selected due to its depositional age, sedimentary environment and organic type, which are similar to the WL shale. The burial history of the WL shale can be divided into five stages: I. Early to Middle Silurian rapid burial; II. Caledonian uplift and denudation; III. Permian to Triassic sustained burial and denudation; IV. sustained burial since the Late Triassic; and V. Late Cretaceous to present sustained uplift and denudation. The thermal maturity of the WL shale in all wells increased with burial depth during stage IV. In addition, high calculated reflectance increments in wells JY1 and N201 during stage III occurred due to the relatively high basal heat flow and deep burial depth, resulting in higher current thermal maturities than in the other wells. The late Permian–Early Triassic and the Middle Jurassic–Early (or Late) Cretaceous were the key methane generation periods for wells JY1 and N201. In contrast, the other five wells had a single methane generation stage, mainly determined by burial and thermal maturation processes. The time of uplift and the amount of denudation during stage V, the current burial depth, the development of faults and fractures, high proportion of retention and the seal capacity of the overlying caprock are key factors for shale gas preservation. Hence, this study will help guide future shale gas development in the Sichuan Basin.",NA,NA,"Sichuan Basin and adjacent areas, southwest China","PetroMod software; gold tube closed-system pyrolysis experiments","IA Cox, JC Pashin - International Journal of Coal Geology, 2024 - Elsevier","The burial and thermal history of sedimentary basins within oblique-slip mobile zones are unique and multifaceted, with irregular periods of subsidence that are closely related to …","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0166516224000430","1","URL:html",NA,NA,"1"

DGGS geologists collected 549 structure measurements, discussed by section below based on the planar feature type, and where appropriate, subdivided by host units. The majority are metamorphic foliations and fold-axial planes. Limited measurements of linear features, such as fold axes, stretched minerals, and intersections lineations, are recorded where observed. Measurements of bedding, fault surfaces, joint surfaces, and vein walls are also limited. Complete field descriptions and locations for station numbers cited can be found in Naibert and others (2020b). Our new geologic mapping (Twelker and others, 2021) extensively revises the known extent of metamorphic terrane boundaries, igneous rocks, and faults. Analysis of the new structural data was undertaken to test prior workers’ metamorphic history and tectonic interpretations for the region, and it provides insights into local structural features within the context of their host unit.",NA,NA,"Mount Fairplay-Ladue River region, Yukon-Tanana Upland, eastern Alaska","helicopter-supported bedrock geologic mapping; structure measurements; 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology","AD Wildland, TJ Naibert - dggs.alaska.gov","During the 2019 field season, the Mineral Resources section of the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) conducted helicopter-supported bedrock …","https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/dggs/ri/text/ri2021_005d.pdf","2; 7; 6","URL:pdf",NA,"Wildland, A.

However, these metals are also subject to issues surrounding the security of their supply, varying from geological and economic factors to technological evolution, the potential for substitutes, the environmental impacts related to extraction and processing, and the usage of these metals. Improving the security of supply of these metals can be approached in numerous ways, including the analysis of known mine supply chains to enable the economic extraction of critical metal by-products, the determination of the critical metal prospectivity of mining/mineral processing wastes, increased amounts of recycling, and the discovery of new and economic deposits of the critical metals. All of these approaches require more information in terms of mineral resource accounting, mineral economics, material flow analysis, mineral processing, as well as increased economic geology knowledge that would enable the making of future discoveries and increase the likelihood of critical metals being extracted as either primary or by-products.

This paper examines how REEs shape geopolitical strategies and expose supply chain vulnerabilities, focusing on China’s April 2025 export restrictions, which disrupted U.S. industries by reducing REE sales by 37% and magnet exports by 58%. The study analyzes the economic impacts, including a 45% surge in neodymium prices and production halts in automotive and defense sectors, alongside strategic risks to U.S. national security. It evaluates global responses, such as the June 2025 U.S.-China trade agreement and diversification efforts through the Minerals Security Partnership, which face environmental, economic, and geopolitical barriers. Drawing parallels to oil politics, the paper highlights REEs’ role in resource-based power dynamics. Findings underscore the need for sustainable mining, enhanced recycling, and multilateral governance to mitigate vulnerabilities. Future research should explore equitable REE access and innovative substitutes to ensure supply chain resilience in an increasingly technology-driven global economy.","Rare Earth Elements; Geopolitics; U.S.-China Trade War; Supply Chain Vulnerabilities; National Security",NA,NA,"Qualitative analysis; Review of primary and secondary sources","LEVFÁ Márkus, T Tőkés - academia.edu","The aim of this paper is to evaluate China's growing geopolitical importance through a brief overview and an analysis of the US-Chinese relations after World War II.

This area is characterized by historically low seismicity, but by April 2024 it has experienced 97 small earthquakes listed in the United States Geological Survey (USGS) catalog, presenting a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of earthquake swarms in stable continental regions. These events are located in a north–south diffuse trend, cross-cutting the Eastern Piedmont Fault System, a Late Paleozoic dextral strike-slip fault, however, the location uncertainties were too large to reveal any obvious structure. Starting from October 2022, we deployed 86 Smartsolo 5-Hz 3-component seismic nodes for four months in the direct vicinity of the Elgin swarm. By using a combination of deep learning and match filter techniques for event detection, and double-difference relocation method for precise earthquake locations, we obtain up to 100 high-resolution microearthquake locations, as compared with 4 events listed in the USGS catalog for the deployment period. In our improved catalog, we report significantly smaller magnitudes in comparison to those listed in the USGS catalog, with a local magnitude ranging from -2.17 to 2.54 and achieving a magnitude of completeness at -0.20. The relocated catalog outlined a single fault plane of nearly north–south strike and west–dipping, inconsistent with either known fault strikes or the magnetic anomalies in this region. We also determine focal mechanism solutions for selected events in this swarm sequence, which shows mainly strike-slip faulting with nodal planes aligning with the north–south striking seismic cluster. Our relocated catalog can be used to constrain the location of other swarm events outside the nodal recording period and provide a robust benchmark dataset for further analysis of the swarm sequence.",NA,NA,"Elgin and Lugoff, South Carolina, USA","deployment of 86 Smartsolo 5-Hz 3-component seismic nodes; deep learning techniques for event detection; match filter techniques for event detection; double-difference relocation method for precise earthquake locations","OE Adeboboye, LY Chuang, M Neves, Z Peng, D Frost… - eartharxiv.org","Localized west-dipping seismic structure defines the Elgin–Lugoff Swarm Sequence in South Carolina Page 1 Localized west-dipping seismic structure defines 1 the Elgin–Lugoff Swarm …","https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/7610/download/15723/","5","URL:pdf",NA,"Adeboboye, Oluwaseyifunmi E.; Chuang, Lindsay Y.; Miguel Neves (School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute Of Technology, USA; Université Côte d’Azur, IRD, CNRS, OCA, Géoazur, Sophia Antipolis, France); Peng, Z. h. i. g. a. n. g.; Frost, D. a. n.; Jaumé, Steven C.","1"
